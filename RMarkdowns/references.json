		"abstract": "In primate groups, collective movements are typically described as processes dependent on leadership mechanisms. However, in some species, decision-making includes negotiations and distributed leadership. These facts suggest that simple underlying processes may explain certain decision mechanisms during collective movements. To study such processes, we have designed experiments on white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) during which we provoked collective movements involving a binary choice. These experiments enabled us to analyse the spatial decisions of individuals in the group. We found that the underlying process includes anonymous mimetism, which means that each individual may inﬂuence all members of the group. To support this result, we created a mathematical model issued from our experimental data. A totally anonymous model does not ﬁt perfectly with our experimental distribution. A more individualised model, which takes into account the speciﬁc behaviour of social peripheral individuals, revealed the validity of the mimetism hypothesis. Even though white-faced capuchins have complex cognitive abilities, a coexistence of anonymous and social mechanisms appears to inﬂuence their choice of direction during collective movements. The present approach may offer vital insights into the relationships between individual behaviours and their emergent collective acts.",

		"abstract": "Moving animal groups display remarkable feats of coordination. This coordination is largely achieved when individuals adjust their movement in response to their neighbours’ movements and positions. Recent advancements in automated tracking technologies, including computer vision and GPS, now allow researchers to gather large amounts of data on the movements and positions of individuals in groups. Furthermore, analytical techniques from fields such as statistical physics now allow us to identify the precise interaction rules used by animals on the move. These interaction rules differ not only between species, but also between individuals in the same group. These differences have wide-ranging implications, affecting how groups make collective decisions and driving the evolution of collective motion. Here, I describe how trajectory data can be used to infer how animals interact in moving groups. I give examples of the similarities and differences in the spatial and directional organisations of animal groups between species, and discuss the rules that animals use to achieve this organisation. I then explore how groups of the same species can exhibit different structures, and ask whether this results from individuals adapting their interaction rules. I then examine how the interaction rules between individuals in the same groups can also differ, and discuss how this can affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Finally, I suggest areas of future research.",

		"abstract": "Group-living species have to coordinate collective actions to maintain cohesion. In primates, spatial movements represent a meaningful model to study group coordination processes across different socio-ecological contexts. We studied 4 groups of red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, between 2008 and 2010 across different ecological and reproductive seasons. We collected data on ranging patterns using GPS collars and observational data on different predefined parameters of group movements, including initiation, leadership, followership, overtaking events, termination, and travel distances. Cohesion of these relatively small, egalitarian lemur groups was high year-round, but daily path length and home range size varied considerably between ecological seasons, presumably due to long-distance migrations of some groups at the beginning of the rainy season. Individuals of different age and sex classes successfully initiated group movements. However, stable female leadership prevailed year-round, irrespective of ecological and reproductive season, which might be due to higher or more specific energetic requirements of reproduction. In contrast to lemur species with a more despotic social structure, female red-fronted lemurs did not recruit more followers than males. Adult leaders recruited more followers than subadult ones. Further, recruitment success was higher during the peak of the dry season, when predation risk appeared to be higher. Distances of single group movements did not depend on the initiator’s sex and age or on ecological seasons. Our results provide new insights into seasonal variability of coordination processes and the role of social dominance in lemur group movements, thereby contributing to a comparative perspective from a primate radiation that evolved group living independently of anthropoids.",

		"abstract": "Socio-ecological models aim to predict the variation in social systems based on a limited number of ecological parameters. Since the 1960s, the original model has taken two paths: one relating to grouping patterns and mating systems and one relating to grouping patterns and female social structure. Here, we review the basic ideas specifically with regard to non-human primates, present new results and point to open questions. While most primates live in permanent groups and exhibit female defence polygyny, recent studies indicate more flexibility with cooperative male resource defence occurring repeatedly in all radiations. In contrast to other animals, the potential link between ecology and these mating systems remains, however, largely unexplored. The model of the ecology of female social structure has often been deemed successful, but has recently been criticized. We show that the predicted association of agonistic rates and despotism (directional consistency of relationships) was not supported in a comparative test. The overall variation in despotism is probably due to phylogenetic grade shifts. At the same time, it varies within clades more or less in the direction predicted by the model. This suggests that the model's utility may lie in predicting social variation within but not across clades.",

		"abstract": "Ecological models of mating systems provide a theoretical framework to predict the effect of the defendability of both breeding resources and mating partners on mating patterns. In resource-based mating systems, male control over breeding resources is tightly linked to female mating preference. To date, few field studies have experimentally investigated the relationship between male resource control and female mating preference in mammals due to difficulties in manipulating ecological factors (e.g., food contestability). We tested the within-group male resource defense hypothesis experimentally in a wild population of black capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) in Iguazú National Park, Argentina. Sapajus spp. represent an ideal study model as, in contrast to most primates, they have been previously argued to be characterized by female mate choice and a resource-based mating system in which within-group resource monopolization by high-ranking males drives female mating preference for those males. Here, we examined whether females (N = 12) showed a weaker preference for alpha males during mating seasons in which food distribution was experimentally manipulated to be less defendable relative to those in which it was highly defendable. Results did not support the within-group male resource defense hypothesis, as female sexual preferences for alpha males did not vary based on food defendability. We discuss possible reasons for our results, including the possibility of other direct and indirect benefits females receive in exercising mate choice, the potential lack of tolerance over food directed towards females by alpha males, and phylogenetic constraints.",

		"abstract": "Capuchins exhibit considerable cross-site variation in domains such as foraging strategy, vocal communication and social interaction. We report interactions between white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) and other species. We present comparative data for 11 groups from 3 sites in Costa Rica that are ecologically similar and geographically close, thus reducing the likelihood that differences are due solely to genetic or ecological differences. Our aim is to document both the range of variation and common elements across sites and situations. We also consider factors that contribute to the variation or consistency or both, including social learning, local ecology, and temperament. We consider 4 categories of allospecifics: (1) vertebrate prey, (2) potential predators, (3) feeding competitors, and (4) neutral species. Although we cannot rule out local differences in ecology, our data suggest that social learning may account for at least some cross-site differences in behavior toward allospecifics. Our strongest finding is that boldness, aggression and pugnacity are displayed consistently across sites, groups and circumstances, even in interactions with neutral species, which reflects a critical aspect of species-specific temperament in Cebus capucinus that has been evolutionarily developed and reinforced through highly opportunistic foraging, strong predator defense, and active hunting. We suggest directions for future research, particularly in regard to primate temperament as an evolved trait with consequences for fitness.",

		"abstract": "Male white-faced capuchins are expected to have tense, yet cooperative, relationships because they must compete for matings in an intragroup context, yet males of the same group need one another's support for intergroup competition for mates. In this paper, I examine in detail the social relationships of the 4 adult males in a single social group of wild white-faced capuchins at Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica. There was a clear alpha male, to whom all other males deferred; however, there was no obvious linear ranking among the subordinate males. Urine rubbing and branch displays were performed more often by the alpha than by subordinate males, though one subordinate male increased his rates of these behaviours when the alpha male was out of view. The alpha male formed coalitions with subordinate males against other males, but pairs of subordinate males never formed coalitions against the alpha male. The alpha male was not consistent with regard to which subordinate male he supported in triadic interactions. Affiliative interactions between subordinate males were consistently disrupted by the alpha male. Males cooperated with one another in the context of defense against predators and defense against males of other social groups. Relaxed affiliation and close proximity between males were rare, in comparison with male-female and female-female dyads. Tense affiliation (e.g. wheeze dances, play, and rough grooming) was most common following a change in alpha male, when aggressive interactions were also more common. Despite males' relatively low rates of affiliation and proximity, males actively searched for one another when a male was missing from the group for an extended period of time.",

		"abstract": "Group living can confer advantages to individuals, but it can also impose severe costs through resource competition. Kleptoparasitism is one example in which some individuals (joiners) can exploit the food discovered by other animals (finders). This type of social foraging has been modelled either as an information-sharing model or as a producer–scrounger game. An important variable in these models is the finder's advantage: the number of items obtained by the finder before the arrival of other individuals. In this study we describe how the spatial position and rank of individuals in a group of wild tufted capuchin monkeys affect their ability to discover and exploit new food sources. We also analyse the factors that affect the finder's share and the total amount of food obtained by the finder from a newly discovered resource. By placing platforms filled with bananas at novel locations in their home range, we show that animals in the leading edge of a foraging group have a higher probability of discovering new food sources than animals occupying other spatial positions. The alpha male and the alpha female, which tended to occupy central-forward positions, were able to monopolize newly discovered food sources and thus obtain a major share of them. The finder's share at the feeding platforms was smaller when there was more food on a platform, but increased with longer delays before the arrival of other individuals. The total amount of food obtained by the finder from the feeding platforms was larger when there was more food on the platform, when the finder was of higher social status, and when it took longer for other individuals to arrive. Animals can increase their finder's share and total amount consumed from a newly discovered resource by keeping large interindividual distances and by avoiding giving cues about the presence of food (such as food-associated vocalizations) to other animals.",

		"abstract": "The classic literature on predation dealt almost exclusively with solitary predators and their prey. Going back to Lotka-Volterra and optimal foraging theory, the theory about predation, including predator-prey population dynamics, was developed for solitary species. Various consequences of sociality for predators have been considered only recently. Similarly, while it was long recognized that prey species can benefit from living in groups, research on the adaptive value of sociality for prey species mostly emerged in the 1970s. The main theme of this book is the various ways that predators and prey may benefit from living in groups. The first part focusses on predators and explores how group membership influences predation success rate, from searching to subduing prey. The second part focusses on how prey in groups can detect and escape predators. The final section explores group size and composition and how individuals respond over evolutionary times to the challenges posed by chasing or being chased by animals in groups. This book will help the reader understand current issues in social predation theory and provide a synthesis of the literature across a broad range of animal taxa.",

But students in these disciplines often seriously lack the tools to understand them. A primer on behavioral modeling that includes both mathematics and evolutionary theory, Mathematical Models of Social Evolution aims to make the student and professional researcher in biology and the social sciences fully conversant in the language of the field.  Teaching biological concepts from which models can be developed, Richard McElreath and Robert Boyd introduce readers to many of the typical mathematical tools that are used to analyze evolutionary models and end each chapter with a set of problems that draw upon these techniques. Mathematical Models of Social Evolution equips behaviorists and evolutionary biologists with the mathematical knowledge to truly understand the models on which their research depends. Ultimately, McElreath and Boyd’s goal is to impart the fundamental concepts that underlie modern biological understandings of the evolution of behavior so that readers will be able to more fully appreciate journal articles and scientific literature, and start building models of their own.",

		"abstract": "An important extension to our understanding of evolutionary processes has been the discovery of the roles that individual and social learning play in creating recurring phenotypes on which selection can act. Cultural change occurs chiefly through invention of new behavioral variants combined with social transmission of the novel behaviors to new practitioners. Therefore, understanding what makes some individuals more likely to innovate and/or transmit new behaviors is critical for creating realistic models of culture change. The difficulty in identifying what behaviors qualify as new in wild animal populations has inhibited researchers from understanding the characteristics of behavioral innovations and innovators. Here, we present the findings of a long-term, systematic study of innovation (10 y, 10 groups, and 234 individuals) in wild capuchin monkeys (\n              Cebus capucinus\n              ) in Lomas Barbudal, Costa Rica. Our methodology explicitly seeks novel behaviors, requiring their absence during the first 5 y of the study to qualify as novel in the second 5 y of the study. Only about 20% of 187 innovations identified were retained in innovators’ individual behavioral repertoires, and 22% were subsequently seen in other group members. Older, more social monkeys were more likely to invent new forms of social interaction, whereas younger monkeys were more likely to innovate in other behavioral domains (foraging, investigative, and self-directed behaviors). Sex and rank had little effect on innovative tendencies. Relative to apes, capuchins devote more of their innovations repertoire to investigative behaviors and social bonding behaviors and less to foraging and comfort behaviors.",

		"abstract": "Our understanding of the social lives of microbes has been revolutionized over the past 20 years. It used to be assumed that bacteria and other microorganisms lived relatively independent unicellular lives, without the cooperative behaviors that have provoked so much interest in mammals, birds, and insects. However, a rapidly expanding body of research has completely overturned this idea, showing that microbes indulge in a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation, communication, and synchronization. Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition between relatives, and enforcement of cooperation. Our aim here is to review these social behaviors, emphasizing the unique opportunities they offer for testing existing evolutionary theory as well as highlighting the novel theoretical problems that they pose.",

It adopts a coherent structure that deals initially with the characteristics and strategies of females, before covering those of males, cooperative societies and hominid societies. It reviews our current understanding both of the structure of societies and of the strategies of individuals; it combines coverage of relevant areas of theory with coverage of interspecific comparisons, intraspecific comparisons and experiments; it explores both evolutionary causes of different traits and their ecological consequences; and it integrates research on different groups of mammals with research on primates and humans and attempts to put research on human societies into a broader perspective.",

These analyses contribute to various subﬁelds of ecology – inter alia behavioral, disease, landscape, resource, and wildlife –and facilitate novel exploration in ﬁelds ranging from conservation planning to public health. Despite the growing availability and general accessibility of animal movement data, much potential remains for the analytical methods of movement ecology to be incorporated in all types of geographic analyses. This review provides for the Geographical Information Sciences (GIS) community an overview of the most common movement metrics and methods of analysis employed by animal ecologists.

		"abstract": "A decline in the density of trees and the deterioration of the habitat of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, have been accompanied by movement of vervet groups into unfamiliar areas. These home range shifts were documented over a period of 26 months. The largest group moved into the home ranges of neighboring groups and acquired more trees, a resource that had become more limited. The groups whose home ranges were encroached upon did not share their home ranges with the intruders, but instead moved into areas that were unoccupied and had a lower density of trees. The largest group was thus more successful than smaller groups in competition for limited resources. For all but one group, movement into new areas was directly associated with the disappearances of female and immature monkeys. Most of the disappearances were attributable to predation. These results suggest that the cost of predation in unfamiliar areas may contribute to the evolution of philopatry in vervets. However, under unstable conditions, resource competition forces these animals to disperse (in groups) despite the high risk of predation.",

		"abstract": "Group size is an important trait of social animals, affecting how individuals allocate time and use space, and influencing both an individual’s fitness and the collective, cooperative behaviors of the group as a whole. Here we tested predictions motivated by the ecological constraints model of group size, examining the effects of group size on ranging patterns and adult female glucocorticoid (stress hormone) concentrations in five social groups of wild baboons (\n              Papio cynocephalus\n              ) over an 11-y period. Strikingly, we found evidence that intermediate-sized groups have energetically optimal space-use strategies; both large and small groups experience ranging disadvantages, in contrast to the commonly reported positive linear relationship between group size and home range area and daily travel distance, which depict a disadvantage only in large groups. Specifically, we observed a U-shaped relationship between group size and home range area, average daily distance traveled, evenness of space use within the home range, and glucocorticoid concentrations. We propose that a likely explanation for these U-shaped patterns is that large, socially dominant groups are constrained by within-group competition, whereas small, socially subordinate groups are constrained by between-group competition and predation pressures. Overall, our results provide testable hypotheses for evaluating group-size constraints in other group-living species, in which the costs of intra- and intergroup competition vary as a function of group size.",

		"abstract": "In social animals, areas where the home ranges of neighboring groups overlap are often underused. The Risk Hypothesis posits that the costs of intergroup conflict create a “landscape of fear,” discouraging the use of such shared areas. To test this hypothesis, we observed the behavior of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in central vs. peripheral areas of their home ranges. If capuchins perceive areas of home range overlap as “risky,” we predicted they would change activity budgets, vocalization rates, and foraging behavior in these areas. A spatially explicit behavioral comparison based on nearly 100 h of focal follows revealed that capuchins socialize less in the periphery (vs. the center) of their home range. Time spent resting, foraging, and engaging in vigilance, as well as vocalization rates, varied in consistent ways across all four study groups, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Fruit trees near range borders (vs. the center) contained more ripe fruit, and groups spent more time in these trees, with more individuals entering to feed and consuming more fruits. However, capuchins did not alter their foraging behavior in potentially risky peripheral areas in a manner consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory: intake rates at patch departure were not significantly lower and groups depleted trees to a greater extent along the periphery vs. in the center of their range. These results suggest that while peripheral areas are perceived as risky and this “landscape of fear” contributes to behavioral changes, they also provide resources whose value may outweigh the cost of intergroup encounters.",

Life tables were constructed separately for four large ( > 15 individuals) and four small groups (< 15 individuals). Female reproductive success, and its relative contribution to population growth, was much higher in large groups, primarily through higher age-specific fecundity. Age-specific survivorship was similar in groups of different sizes. The reproductive success of the single breeding male in a group was much higher in large than small groups. Compared to small groups, breeding males in large groups had a longer breeding tenure, and access to greater numbers of reproductive females with a higher average fecundity. Differences in female reproductive success apparently resulted from variation in access to monopolizable fruit trees. Large groups predictably displaced small groups during intergroup encounters. Group rank depended on the number of males resident in groups. The large number of non-breeding males in large groups results from their longer average residency time. I explain the longer residency of males in large groups by the higher average reproductive success of breeding males in these groups.",

For motile species, this ‘upscaling’ is governed by how well any given movement strategy maximizes encounters with positive factors, and minimizes encounters with negative factors. Despite the importance of encounter events for a broad range of ecological processes, encounter theory has not kept pace with developments in animal tracking or movement modeling. Furthermore, existing work has focused primarily on the relationship between animal movement and encounter\n                  rates\n                  while no theoretical framework exists for directly relating individual movement with the spatial\n                  locations\n                  of encounter events in the environment.\n                \n              \n              \n                Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a new theoretical concept describing the long-term encounter location probabilities for movement within home ranges, termed the conditional distribution of encounters (CDE). We then derive this distribution, as well as confidence intervals, implement its statistical estimator into open source software, and demonstrate the broad ecological relevance of this novel concept.\n              \n              \n                \n                  We first use simulated data to show how our estimator provides asymptotically consistent estimates. We then demonstrate the general utility of this method for three simulation-based scenarios that occur routinely in biological systems: i) a population of individuals with home ranges that overlap with neighbors; ii) a pair of individuals with a hard territorial border between their home ranges; and iii) a predator with a large home range that encompassed the home ranges of multiple prey individuals. Using GPS data from white-faced capuchins (\n                  Cebus capucinus\n                  ) tracked on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and sleepy lizards (\n                  Tiliqua rugosa\n                  ) tracked in Bundey, South Australia, we then show how the CDE can be used to estimate the locations of territorial borders, identify key resources, quantify the location-specific potential for competition, and/or identify any changes in behaviour that directly result from location-specific encounter probability.\n                \n              \n              \n                This novel target distribution enables researchers to better understand the dynamics of populations of interacting individuals. Notably, the general estimation framework developed in this work builds straightforwardly off of home range estimation and requires no specialised data collection protocols. This method is now openly available via the ctmm R package.",

		"abstract": "Encounter rates link movement strategies to intra- and inter-speciﬁc interactions, and therefore translate individual movement behavior into higher-level ecological processes. Indeed, a large body of interacting population theory rests on the law of mass action, which can be derived from assumptions of Brownian motion in an enclosed container with exclusively local perception. These assumptions imply completely uniform space use, individual home ranges equivalent to the population range, and encounter dependent on movement paths actually crossing. Mounting empirical evidence, however, suggests that animals use space non-uniformly, occupy home ranges substantially smaller than the population range, and are often capable of nonlocal perception. Here, we explore how these empirically supported behaviors change pairwise encounter rates. Speciﬁcally, we derive novel analytical expressions for encounter rates under Ornstein-Uhlenbeck motion, which features non-uniform space use and allows individual home ranges to differ from the population range. We compare OU-based encounter predictions to those of Reﬂected Brownian Motion, from which the law of mass action can be derived. For both models, we further explore how the interplay between the scale of perception and home-range size affects encounter rates. We ﬁnd that neglecting realistic movement and perceptual behaviors can lead to systematic, non-negligible biases in encounter-rate predictions.",

		"abstract": "A variety of methods are commonly used to quantify animal home ranges using location data acquired with telemetry. High-volume location data from global positioning system (GPS) technology provide researchers the opportunity to identify various intensities of use within home ranges, typically quantiﬁed through utilization distributions (UDs). However, the wide range of variability evident within UDs constructed with modern home range estimators is often overlooked or ignored during home range comparisons, and challenges may arise when summarizing distributional shifts among multiple UDs. We describe an approach to gain additional insight into home range changes by comparing UDs across isopleths and summarizing comparisons into meaningful results. To demonstrate the efﬁcacy of this approach, we used GPS location data from 16 bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to identify distributional changes before and after habitat alterations, and we discuss advantages in its application when comparing home range size, overlap, and joint-space use. We found a consistent increase in bighorn sheep home range size when measured across home range levels, but that home range overlap and similarity values decreased when examined at increasing core levels. Our results highlight the beneﬁt of conducting multiscale assessments when comparing distributions, and we encourage researchers to expand comparative home range analyses to gain a more comprehensive evaluation of distributional changes and to evaluate comparisons across home range levels.",

In chimpanzees adult males play an important role in defending the HR against neighbors, and therefore it has been suggested that HR size depends on the number of adult males. In this long-term study on wild West African chimpanzees, we analyzed the relative importance of community size and composition on ranging patterns over a 10-year period, using multivariate statistics. Because community size decreased from 51 individuals with 6 adult males in 1992 to 22 individuals with only 1 adult male in 2001, we expected a decrease in HR size, which should be better predicted by the number of males than by community size. We further investigated the effect of fruit availability on monthly HRs over a 4-year period. As predicted, HR size decreased during the ﬁrst 7 years of our study but increased during the last 3 years. Overall, the number of adult males was the best predictor of HR size, whereas fruit availability did not correlate with HR size. HR use remained stable over the entire study period, with a constant proportion of about 35% of the HR used as core area. High HR and core-area overlap values between different years indicated strong site-ﬁdelity. Although the number of males within the community explained the decrease in HR size, the recent increase in size remains unexplained.",

Two important factors that influence collective decision-making are information uncertainty and conflicting preferences. Here, I bring together, and briefly review, basic models relating to animal collective decision-making in situations with information uncertainty and in situations with conflicting preferences between group members. The intention is to give an overview about the different types of modelling approaches that have been employed and the questions that they address and raise. Despite the use of a wide range of different modelling techniques, results show a coherent picture, as follows. Relatively simple cognitive mechanisms can lead to effective information pooling. Groups often face a trade-off between decision accuracy and speed, but appropriate fine-tuning of behavioural parameters could achieve high accuracy while maintaining reasonable speed. The right balance of interdependence and independence between animals is crucial for maintaining group cohesion and achieving high decision accuracy. In conflict situations, a high degree of decision-sharing between individuals is predicted, as well as transient leadership and leadership according to needs and physiological status. Animals often face crucial trade-offs between maintaining group cohesion and influencing the decision outcome in their own favour. Despite the great progress that has been made, there remains one big gap in our knowledge: how do animals make collective decisions in situations when information uncertainty and conflict of interest operate simultaneously?",

Previous studies have shown that social organisms frequently benefit from pooling imperfect individual estimates. However, in principle, collective intelligence may also emerge from interactions between individuals, rather than from the enhancement of personal estimates. Here, we reveal that this emergent problem solving is the predominant mechanism by which a mobile animal group responds to complex environmental gradients. Robust collective sensing arises at the group level from individuals modulating their speed in response to local, scalar, measurements of light and through social interaction with others. This distributed sensing requires only rudimentary cognition and thus could be widespread across biological taxa, in addition to being appropriate and cost-effective for robotic agents.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.",

		"abstract": "Organisms have evolved sensory mechanisms to extract pertinent information from their environment, enabling them to assess their situation and act accordingly. For social organisms travelling in groups, like the fish in a school or the birds in a flock, sharing information can further improve their situational awareness and reaction times. Data on the benefits and costs of social coordination, however, have largely allowed our understanding of why collective behaviours have evolved to outpace our mechanistic knowledge of how they arise. Recent studies have begun to correct this imbalance through fine-scale analyses of group movement data. One approach that has received renewed attention is the use of information theoretic (IT) tools like\n              mutual information\n              ,\n              transfer entropy\n              and\n              causation entropy\n              , which can help identify causal interactions in the type of complex, dynamical patterns often on display when organisms act collectively. Yet, there is a communications gap between studies focused on the ecological constraints and solutions of collective action with those demonstrating the promise of IT tools in this arena. We attempt to bridge this divide through a series of ecologically motivated examples designed to illustrate the benefits and challenges of using IT tools to extract deeper insights into the interaction patterns governing group-level dynamics. We summarize some of the approaches taken thus far to circumvent existing challenges in this area and we conclude with an optimistic, yet cautionary perspective.",

A single group of wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) was studied in Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica, for 24 months. A total of 953 hours of focal animal data were collected on 4 adult males and 6 adult females. The patterning of social interactions was studied in an attempt to assess the outcome of disputes between males and females. In dyadic interactions, females avoided and cowered to males roughly 50 times more often than males avoided or cowered to females. Females responded fearfully to 12% of males' neutral approaches, whereas males never responded fearfully to females' neutral approaches. Males supplanted females 15 times more often than females supplanted males. The alpha male spent more time with females than did lower-ranking males. In general, males were more responsible for proximity maintenance within male-female dyads than were the females. Females behaved aggressively to males slightly more often than vice versa, but males inflicted more severe aggression on females. The types of benefits that each sex conferred on the other were largely different. Females groomed males, but males virtually never reciprocated. Both males and females aided one another in coalitions, which were primarily directed against adult male capuchins and non-monkeys. During one portion of the study, comparison among heterosexual dyads revealed associations between male coalitionary support and both (a) female coalitionary support and (b) female grooming, suggesting interchanges of benefits. Females were able to compensate, in part, for their subordinate status relative to males, by frequently forming coalitions with other females against males. Males did not form coalitions with other adult males against females. Female-female coalitions were effective for achieving immediate goals, such as evicting males from feeding trees. However, even determined coalitions of females were ineffective in their attempts to control male group membership, without receiving aid from adult males.",

		"abstract": "Cebus capucinus has converged with Old World monkeys by having strong, long-term social bonds among related females that are characterized by linear dominance hierarchies, frequent grooming, and coalition formation, biased toward maternal kin. Males also maintain long-term relationships with kin, by comigrating with close male relatives. Males need male allies to take over groups with mature females. The alpha male sires virtually all offspring born to females who are not his direct descendants. Thus, the males who assist the alpha male in gaining and preserving access to breeding females typically must delay breeding until the alpha male's daughters have matured. Infanticide by alpha males is the primary cause of infant death. Females support the current alpha male, thereby preventing disruptive takeovers that could result in infanticide. Some alpha males maintain their position for up to 18years. Under such conditions, survival rates and the average degree of relatedness within a group are high. High male reproductive skew, frequent coalitionary lethal aggression, and infanticide put selective pressures on both males and females to engage in coalition formation. The rich repertoire of stereotyped recruitment signals suggests a long evolutionary history of coalition formation. The unusual diversity of traditional dyadic social conventions in this species may also be a consequence of selection for ability to test the quality of social bonds.",

		"abstract": "Coordinated travel by social groups is well documented, often with evidence that cognitive spatial maps are employed. Yet the mechanisms by which movement decisions are made and implemented within social groups are poorly known. In a field study of white-faced capuchin monkeys in Costa Rica it was demonstrated that a specific call, the “trill,” is used by adults in the initiation and directing of troop movement. The trills of subadults were restricted to vocal exchanges with other subadults. Continuous vocal recordings were collected of the vocalizations of the 14 members of the study troop. A cumulative 33.7 h of continuous samples and 1,892 sonagrams were analyzed. In addition to vocalizations clearly associated with alarm, distress, or agonistic contexts, two distinct call types were identified, trills and huhs. Age-sex classes differed in the rate at which both types of calls were produced in different spatial positions within the troop. Adult females and males produced higher rates of trills when in the leading edge compared to all other spatial positions in a traveling troop. Trills at the edge of a stationary troop represented 36 “successful” and 3 “unsuccessful” start attempts; the troop usually moved in the trajectory predicted by a trilling adult's location on the troop periphery within 10 min of the initiation of trilling. Adults also altered the trajectory of traveling troops by trilling at the side and back of the troop (10 “successful” and 4 “unsuccessful” attempts). Huh vocalizations were most predictably produced when a capuchin is in a dense fruit patch. These results emphasize the role vocalizations serve in the coordination and trajectory of group movement in nonhuman primates, especially those populations that are arboreal or in which visual contact is otherwise impeded. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

		"abstract": "Vocal communication plays a particularly important role in the regulation of social interactions and in the coordination of activities in many mammals and birds that are organised into social groups. Previous research on the function and evolution of vocal signals has mainly considered dyadic interactions of a signaller and its addressed receiver. However, in social groups it is likely that additional individuals attend to dyadic communication and that they use this information to their own benefit, sometimes at a cost to the signaller. To improve existing communication models, benefits and costs of vocal communication caused by bystanders must therefore also be considered. Here we discuss vocal communication in social groups and identify the effects of additional individuals on signalling interactions, concentrating on audience effects, eavesdropping and group coordination. First, a review of the existing literature reveals that the presence of an audience, i.e., additional individuals within the signalling range, clearly affects the outcome of communicative interactions, and that individuals modulate their signalling behaviour according to the presence of bystanders or a particular category of bystanders in a variety of contexts. Second, social knowledge acquired by eavesdropping on the communicative network within a group influences not only future actions, but can also provide individual benefits for eavesdroppers, whereas mutual eavesdropping can structure cooperation and alliance formation, and, hence, contribute to long-term group stability. Third, communicative networks also provide a means to facilitate the maintenance of group cohesion and decisionmaking processes. In conclusion, cost-benefit analyses at the level of dyadic interactions reveal clear differences with communication networks, where repeated interactions with multiple partners are considered. Future communication models and empirical studies should therefore consider the composition of the entire communication network as well as the effects of repeated interactions to fully understand signalling interactions in social groups.",

		"abstract": "In animal societies, conﬂicts can be resolved by combatants or through third-party intervention. In gregarious species, conﬂicts among pairs can spread to involve multiple individuals. In the case of large conﬂicts, containment and termination of aggression by third parties is important. Successful intervention relies on consensus among combatants about the intervener’s capacity to use force. We refer to this consensus as power. We measure it and study how it arises, using as our model system a pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) society. In macaques, the degree to which one individual perceives another as capable of using force is communicated using a special dominance signal. Group consensus about an individual’s capacity to use force arises from the network of signaling interactions. We derive a formalism to quantify consensus in the network. We ﬁnd that the power distribution is fat tailed and power is a strong predictor of social variables including request for support, intervention cost, and intensity. We develop models to show how dominancesignaling strategies promote robust power distributions despite individual signaling errors. We suggest that when considering correlated interactions among many individuals it can be more useful to emphasize coarse-grained information stored at the group level—behavioral macrostates—over detailed information at the individual level.",

We assume an aggregation economy; individual fitness initially increases with group size, but in sufficiently large groups each member's individual fitness declines with further increments in the size of the group. We model two processes of group formation, designated free entry and group-controlled entry. The first model assumes that solitary individuals decide to join groups or remain alone; group size equilibrates when solitaries no longer choose to join. The second model allows group members to regulate the size of the group, so that the predicted group size results from members' decisions to repel or accept intruding solitaries. Both the Nash equilibrium group size and any change in the equilibrium caused by varying the level of relatedness depend on the particular entry rule assumed. The largest equilibrium group size occurs when solitaries choose between joining or not joining and individuals are unrelated. Increasing genetic relatedness may reduce and can never increase, equilibrium group size when this entry rule applies. The smallest equilibrium group size occurs when group members choose between repelling or accepting intruders and individuals are unrelated. Under this entry rule, increasing genetic relatedness can increase and can never decrease, equilibrium group size. We extend the models' predictions to suggest when individuals should prefer kin vs non-kin as members of the same group.",

		"abstract": "Group size is an important trait of social animals, affecting how individuals allocate time and use space, and influencing both an individual’s fitness and the collective, cooperative behaviors of the group as a whole. Here we tested predictions motivated by the ecological constraints model of group size, examining the effects of group size on ranging patterns and adult female glucocorticoid (stress hormone) concentrations in five social groups of wild baboons (\n              Papio cynocephalus\n              ) over an 11-y period. Strikingly, we found evidence that intermediate-sized groups have energetically optimal space-use strategies; both large and small groups experience ranging disadvantages, in contrast to the commonly reported positive linear relationship between group size and home range area and daily travel distance, which depict a disadvantage only in large groups. Specifically, we observed a U-shaped relationship between group size and home range area, average daily distance traveled, evenness of space use within the home range, and glucocorticoid concentrations. We propose that a likely explanation for these U-shaped patterns is that large, socially dominant groups are constrained by within-group competition, whereas small, socially subordinate groups are constrained by between-group competition and predation pressures. Overall, our results provide testable hypotheses for evaluating group-size constraints in other group-living species, in which the costs of intra- and intergroup competition vary as a function of group size.",

		"abstract": "The spatial scale of animal space use, e.g. measured as individual home range size, is a key trait with important implications for ecological and evolutionary processes as well as management and conservation of populations and ecosystems. Explaining variation in home range size has therefore received great attention in ecological research. However, few studies have examined multiple hypotheses simultaneously, which is important provided the complex interactions between life history, social system and behaviour. Here, we review previous studies on home range size in ungulates, supplementing with a meta-analysis, to assess how differences in habitat use and species characteristics affect the relationship between body mass and home range size. Habitat type was the main factor explaining interspecific differences in home range size after accounting for species body mass and group size. Species using open habitats had larger home ranges for a given body mass than species using closed habitats, whereas species in open habitats showed a much weaker allometric relationship compared with species living in closed habitats. We found no support for relationships between home range size and species diet or mating system, or any sexual differences. These patterns suggest that the spatial scale of animal movement mainly is a combined effect of body mass, group size and the landscape structure. Accordingly, landscape management must acknowledge the influence of spatial distribution of habitat types on animal behaviour to ensure natural processes affecting demography and viability of ungulate populations.",

Yet, it remains challenging to identify the most important drivers—and by extension, the evolutionary mechanisms—of sociality for particular species. Here, we present a conceptual framework, literature review, and model demonstrating that the direction and magnitude of the response of group size to sudden resource shifts provides a strong indication of the underlying drivers of sociality. We catalog six functionally distinct mechanisms related to the acquisition of resources, and we model these mechanisms’ effects on the survival of individuals foraging in groups. We find that whether, and to what degree, optimal group size increases, decreases, or remains constant when resource abundance declines depends strongly on the dominant mechanism. Existing empirical data support our model predictions, and we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict the dominant social benefit for particular species. Together, our framework and results show that a single easily measurable characteristic, namely, group size under different resource abundances, can illuminate the potential drivers of sociality across the tree of life.",

Traditional frameworks in primatology, human ecology, public health, and paleoanthropology view daily energy expenditure as being more variable within than between species, changing with activity level but essentially ﬁxed for a given body size. Growing evidence turns this view on its head. Total energy expenditure (kcal/d), varies relatively little within species, despite variation in physical activity; it varies considerably among species even after controlling for the eﬀect of body size. Embracing this emerging paradigm requires rethinking potential trade-oﬀs in energy allocation within and between species, assessing evidence of metabolic acceleration within lineages, and abandoning activity-based estimates of total energy expenditure. Diﬃcult and exciting work lies ahead in the eﬀort to untangle the ecological and evolutionary pressures shaping primate metabolic diversity.",

A number of game theoretic models (joint ideal free distributions, IFD) have suggested that a population-level distribution of mobile predators and mobile prey in which predators match the distribution of the prey's resources and prey are more evenly distributed will be stable. However, prey can often manage their exposure to predation risk by adjusting their space use and their level of apprehension or vigilance, while predators have been shown to behaviorally manage the risk level perceived by their prey. We used a system of predatory larval dragonflies (Anax junius) and southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) tadpoles to explore how these species respond spatially to habitat features when alone (non-game situations) and together (game situations), then how predation events are distributed in relation to these features. In game and non-game situations, dragonflies avoided each other and showed no preference for tadpole resource patches, while tadpoles favored their resource patches, avoided caged, feeding dragonflies, and used a combination of avoidance and activity reduction to reduce their predation risk. Predation events were generally distributed closer to resource patches and farther from caged predators. The results suggest that dragonflies and tadpoles do not directly follow joint IFD predictions, but manage fear and risk through their behavioral strategies. The results also suggest that stationary or slowly-changing habitat features can anchor predator—prey spatial distributions, but that they are likely to be temporally variable in some systems.",

		"abstract": "Much research in animal communication is aimed at understanding the functional design features of animal vocal signals. Our detailed analyses of the vocalizations and behavioural responses elicited in white-faced capuchins by predators and other disturbances point to two call variants that differ modestly in their acoustic structure and that are accompanied by functionally distinct behavioural responses. The first variant is given exclusively to avian predators and is almost invariably accompanied by the monkey's immediate descent from the treetops where it is most vulnerable; therefore, we label this call variant the 'aerial predator alarm'. The second variant, that differs only slightly but noticeably from the first, is given to a wide range of snakes and mammals, including a range of species that represent no predatory threat to the monkeys. This second call is also associated with more variable responses from calling monkeys, from delayed retreat from the source of disturbance, to active approach, inspection, and sometimes mobbing of the animal involved. We therefore label this variant more generally as an 'alerting call'. Although some other primate species show a more diverse system of anti-predator calls, and the capuchins themselves may yet be found to produce a greater variety of calls, a system of two call variants with varying degrees of predator specificity and behavioural response is not uncommon among primates and appears functionally appropriate for capuchins. The basic structure of the alerting call allows conspecific listeners to localize the caller and the source of disturbance readily, thereby allowing listeners to approach and assist in mobbing in cases where the disturbance warrants it, or to avoid the area in cases where the disturbance is identified as a predatory threat. Conversely, the aerial predator alarm is inherently less localizable and therefore conveys the presence of a predator to conspecific listeners nearby while allowing the signaler itself to remain relatively inconspicuous.",

In this case study, we investigated how group characteristics (size and composition) and fission rates in spider monkeys varied in space and time with rainfall, fruit availability, and fruit variability in two sites, each presenting different characteristics regarding the distribution and size of food patches and rainfall. Habitat characteristics strongly influenced FFD in spider monkeys, particularly subgroup size and fission rate. Subgroup size varied with fruit availability and its variability, while fission rates varied with rainfall and fruit variability. However, both subgroup size and fission rate varied in opposite ways, depending upon habitat type. Subgroups tended to present stable mixed-sex composition regardless of fruit availability. We conclude that for spider monkeys, FFD are part of a flexible behavioral strategy to cope with a locally fluctuating environment and with different environments within the geographic range of the species.",

		"abstract": "Living in groups necessarily involves a certain amount of within-group competition for food. Group members may have different motivations, implying the reaching of a consensus to stay cohesive. In some cases individuals fail to reach a common decision and the group splits; this can be temporary, as seen in fission–fusion dynamics, or even irreversible. Most studies on fission–fusion dynamics published to date have focused on the influence of environmental constraints on sub-grouping patterns, but little is known about how social relationships affect individual choices for sub-groups. In this study, we used an agent-based model to understand the mechanisms underlying group fission in two semi-free-ranging groups of macaques: one group of Tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana) and one of rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). The results showed that sub-grouping patterns were mainly influenced by affiliative relationships. Moreover, the species-specific social style appeared to affect the probability of choosing a particular sub-group. In the tolerant Tonkean macaques, mechanisms underlying sub-grouping patterns resembled anonymous mimetism, while in the nepotistic rhesus macaques, kinship influenced the mechanisms underlying group fissions. As previous studies have shown, fission–fusion society may be a way to avoid social conflicts induced either by food or by social competition.",

		"abstract": "Primate groups need to remain coordinated in their activities and collectively decide when and where to travel if they are to accrue the benefits and minimize the costs of sociality. The achievement of coordinated activity and group decision making therefore has important implications for individual survival and reproduction. The aim of this special issue is to bring together a collection of empirical, theoretical, and commentary articles by primatologists studying this rapidly expanding topic. In this article, we introduce the contributions within the special issue and provide a background to the topic. We begin by focusing on decisions that involve a collective transition between a resting and a moving state, a transition we term making the move. We examine whether specific predeparture behaviors seen during transitions represent intentional processes or more simple response facilitation. Next we classify decisions according to the contribution of individual group members, and describe how, and why, certain individuals can have a disproportionate influence over group-mates’ behavior. We then review how primate groups make decisions on the move. In particular, we focus on how variability in group size and spatial organization helps or hinders information transmission and coordination. We end with a discussion of new tools and methodology that will allow future investigators to address some outstanding questions in primate coordination and decision-making research. We conclude that a better integration of concepts and terminology, along with a focus on how individuals integrate environmental and social information, will be critical to developing a satisfactory understanding of collective patterns of behavior in primate systems.",

		"abstract": "<h3>Summary</h3> <p>While the ability of naturally ranging animals to recall the location of food resources and use straight-line routes between them has been demonstrated in several studies, it is not known whether animals can use knowledge of their physical landscape to plan least-cost routes. This ability is likely to be particularly important for animals living in highly variable energy landscapes, where movement costs are exacerbated. Here, we used least-cost modelling to investigate whether chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>) living in a rugged, montane environment use advanced cognitive skills to plan energy efficient routes. We used a subset of chimpanzee movement segments together with the available laboratory measurements of chimpanzee energy expenditure to assign movement ‘costs’ which were incorporated in an anisotropic least-cost model and straight-line null model. The least-cost model performed better than the straight-line model across all parameters, and linear mixed modelling showed a strong relationship between the cost of observed chimpanzee travel and predicted least-cost routes. To our knowledge, our study provides the first example of spatial memory for landscape and the ability to plan least-cost routes in non-human animals. These cognitive abilities may be a key trait that have enabled chimpanzees to maintain their energy balance in a low-resource environment. Our findings provide a further example of how the advanced cognitive complexity of hominids have facilitated their adaptation to a variety of environmental conditions and lead us to hypothesise that landscape complexity may play a role in shaping cognition.</p>",

		"abstract": "Obtaining convincing evidence for spatial memory of natural food sources in wild animals is hard because the observer rarely knows as much about the available food as does the animal, and the ability of the animal to detect novel food sources is usually not measured. In this study, I took advantage of the scarcity of natural fruit sources in the subtropical winter to present a wild group of brown capuchin monkeys with a large-scale array of 15 feeding platforms spaced ca 200 m apart. With this array, I could control the location, productivity and renewal schedule of the major fruit sources used by these animals. Combining an independent measurement of their detection ﬁeld for these platforms with the known locations of the platforms, I calculated the expected patterns of movement among platform sites by the group under various models of ‘random’ foraging. These expected patterns were compared to the actual spatial movements of the group. The capuchin group moved signiﬁcantly more often toward closer platforms and in straighter lines than expected by any random search model using their observed detection ﬁeld of 82 m, although their behaviour did agree with such models for unrealistically large search ﬁelds of 225–350 m. I infer that the movements of this study group are likely to be guided by spatial memory. However, straight-line movement and a preference for closer platforms are in general not convincing evidence for spatial memory unless the detection ﬁeld of the forager for the resources is known.",

Do any nonhuman animals count, imitate one another, use a language, or have a culture? What are the uses of cognition in nature and how might it have evolved? What is the current status of Darwin's claim that other species share the same \"mental powers\" as humans, but to different degrees? In this completely revised second edition of Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior, Sara Shettleworth addresses these questions, among others, by integrating findings from psychology, behavioral ecology, and ethology in a unique and wide-ranging synthesis of theory and research on animal cognition, in the broadest sense—from species-specific adaptations of vision in fish and associative learning in rats to discussions of theory of mind in chimpanzees, dogs, and ravens. She reviews the latest research on topics such as episodic memory, metacognition, and cooperation and other-regarding behavior in animals, as well as recent theories about what makes human cognition unique.In every part of this new edition, Shettleworth incorporates findings and theoretical approaches that have emerged since the first edition was published in 1998. The chapters are now organized into three sections: Fundamental Mechanisms (perception, learning, categorization, memory), Physical Cognition (space, time, number, physical causation), and Social Cognition (social knowledge, social learning, communication). Shettleworth has also added new chapters on evolution and the brain and on numerical cognition, and a new chapter on physical causation that integrates theories of instrumental behavior with discussions of foraging, planning, and tool using.",

		"abstract": "I focus on the foraging efficiency (food intake per time) of a hypothetical forager that uses distinct levels of information about a set of discrete renewing resources. The information may be the distance to the resource (D), both distance and maximum productivity of the resource (DP), or distance, productivity, and the elapsed time since the forager last visited each resource (DPT). The expected foraging efficiencies are based on the results of a field experiment on wild capuchin monkeys (Janson 2016) that documented the use of integrative memories of resource location, productivity, and elapsed time since the previous visit. Computer simulations of the choice process are used to extend the resource parameter space beyond the field experiment. The goal is to explore to what extent the use of elapsed time in choosing discrete feeding sites is a benefit under various conditions of resource and consumer characteristics. Major findings include that the use of elapsed time generally increases foraging efficiency on renewing resources by 30-35%, without much effect of resource size or variability – indeed, DPT outperforms D or DP choice even when all resources have the same productivity. The relative benefit of DPT increases when the most productive resources are only moderately common (not so rare that they contribute little to food intake, nor so common that choosing the nearest resource is likely to arrive at a highly productive one). The relative benefit of DPT decreases when the forager’s gut capacity is small or gut passage time is long because it cannot fully ingest large resource accumulations that occur after long elapsed intervals. I suggest that memory for and use of elapsed intervals since prior visits in foraging choices will prove to be a common feature of diverse foraging animals whenever the presence of a forager depresses food availability in a local area.",

		"abstract": "Tropical forests have a high diversity of tree species which have very low densities and vary across time in their seasons of peak fruiting and maturation rates. As evidence of the ability of primates to track or anticipate changes in fruit production at individual trees, researchers have used the increased speed of primate groups toward more rewarding food patches. We analyzed the speed of approach to natural trees of wild capuchin monkeys under the effect of scramble competition, after excluding any plausible visual, olfactory and auditory cues. We conducted all-day group follows of three habituated capuchin groups at Iguazú National Park, Argentina, collecting data on ranging behavior and patterns of visits to fruit trees in relation with their location and fruit availability. Travel speed varied according to the expected reward at a feeding tree, increasing as rewards increased from low values, but decreasing again at very high values. Also, travel speed varied with time of day, decreasing from the time of first activity as the monkeys became less hungry, and increasing again toward late afternoon. Measures of unripe fruit cover did not explain variation in travel speed at any distance from a focal tree. Our data imply that, after excluding sensory cues, capuchins appear to anticipate time-varying ripe fruit quantity of natural resources, suggesting that they use memory of tree location and anticipation of fruit maturation. We also confirm that speed is a good measure about expectations of resources, as has been shown in previous studies.",

		"abstract": "Studies of the relationship between brain size and body size in terrestrial verteberates have a long history1–4. Demonstrations of regular relationships between brain and body size across species within selected vertebrate groups serve two purposes: (1) in comparison of species of different body size, empirically recognized ‘scaling effects’ can be taken into account; (2) empirical relationships may suggest useful working hypotheses regarding functional constraints (although they cannot directly reveal casual connections). It is widely accepted5,6 that brain size is scaled to keep pace with changes in body surface area (rather than volume), and this provides the basis for many interpretations of relative brain size. Re-examination of brain–body size relationships for large samples of species from three major vertebrate groups (mammals, birds, reptiles) now shows that there is no empirical foundation for the concept of scaling to body surface area. Instead, it seems that brain size may be linked to maternal metabolic turnover. This has implications not only for assessment of relative brain size in particular species, but also for pursuing links between brain size and ‘life strategies’.",

Studies in primate navigation suggest most species navigate through the route network system, using intersections among routes as locations of decision-making. Recent approaches presume that points of directional change may be key locations where animals decide where to go next. Over four consecutive years, we observed how a wild group of bearded capuchin monkeys used a route network system and Change Point locations (CPs) in the Brazilian ecotone of Cerrado–Caatinga. We built 200 daily routes of one wild bearded capuchin group. We used ArcGIS, the Change Point Test, Spatial Analysis in Macroecology (SAM), and statistical models to test the hypothesis that wild bearded capuchins use CPs located along routes in a different fashion than they use the CPs located at intersections of routes. A logistic regression model was used to determine the landscape variables affecting capuchins’ directional changes at intersections or along routes. CPs at intersections were important points of travel path changes, whereas CPs along routes represented a zig-zag movement along the routes following the landscape features. CPs at intersections were associated with steeper terrains and shorter distances from important resources, along with better visibility of the home range. Our results support the hypothesis that intersections among routes in the route network system are located at points where monkeys have the best visibility available to make decisions on where to visit next.",

A “zoo” of different cells transforms the immediate experience of wandering in the environment into a maplike representation, written again and again in specific brain structures. Here we claim that another component is crucial for forming and interpreting these maps – the experiential and imaginary self. Through the concept of mental travel we explain how the self may be projected prior to the use of cognitive maps and how the world is referred to the self through the cognitive map. Biases and influences of the self may further affect the maps formation and interpretation. The concept of mental orientation is then suggested to include the experiencing self and the way in which it relates to the environment, as represented on cognitive maps, not only in spatial navigation but also in the processing of time (memories and plans), people (social world), and even abstract concepts.",

		"abstract": "We investigated long-term site fidelity of gray-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) groups in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Concurrently, we monitored shifts in home range by individual females and subadult and adult males. We documented home range stability by calculating the area of overlap in successive years, and by recording the drift of each group’s monthly centroid from its initial location. Home ranges remained stable for 3 of our 4 groups (overlap over 10 yr >60%). Core areas were more labile, but group centroids drifted an average of only 530 m over the entire decade. Deviations from site fidelity were associated with dispersal or group fission. During natal dispersal, subadult males expanded their home ranges over many months, settling ≤4 home ranges away. Adult males, in contrast, typically dispersed within a few days to an adjacent group in an area of home range overlap. Adult males made solitary forays, but nearly always into areas used by their current group or by a group to which they had previously belonged. After secondary dispersal, they expanded their ranging in the company of their new group, apparently without prior solitary exploration of the new area. Some females also participated in home range shifts. Females shifted home ranges only within social groups, in association with temporary or permanent group splits. Our observations raise the possibility that male mangabeys use a finder-joiner mechanism when moving into new home ranges during secondary dispersal.",

		"abstract": "Successful bird migration can depend on individual learning, social learning, and innate navigation programs. Using 8 years of data on migrating whooping cranes, we were able to partition genetic and socially learned aspects of migration. Specifically, we analyzed data from a reintroduced population wherein all birds were captive bred and artificially trained by ultralight aircraft on their first lifetime migration. For subsequent migrations, in which birds fly individually or in groups but without ultralight escort, we found evidence of long-term social learning, but no effect of genetic relatedness on migratory performance. Social learning from older birds reduced deviations from a straight-line path, with 7 years of experience yielding a 38% improvement in migratory accuracy.",

We expect individuals to use a mode of transportation that is used by others in their social network. However, other factors important to mode choice, such as commute characteristics or transit access, may inﬂuence multiple members of a social network at the same time. Thus it is necessary to estimate the effects of social inﬂuence while taking into account the potential effects of shared environmental characteristics. We hypothesize that social inﬂuence is relevant to transportation mode choice, even when accounting for shared environmental characteristics among members of a social network. We explore this hypothesis, utilizing survey data collected from a sample of university students, in Davis California. The survey collected information about respondents' social networks, the transportation mode choices of their social contacts, and geographic information for the respondent and their social network. We estimate models using instrumental variables measuring neighborhood characteristics of the social contacts. Results provide evidence that social processes are important to travel behavior, even when accounting for similarities in behavior that may be attributed to similar choice environments.",

Such socially learned route preferences can be stably maintained over multiple transmission episodes, sometimes forming long-lived traditions. In humans, preferences for familiar routes or heavily used worn trails over unfamiliar ones have been described in various contexts. However, social learning of route preferences has not been experimentally demonstrated in humans. Here, we demonstrate that social learning and tradition influence route choice. We led adult male and female participants into a room by one of two routes. Participants followed the demonstrated route choices, and later remembered and preferred this choice even when determinably suboptimal (i.e. longer and not preferred by control participants) or when the choice was indicated as arbitrary (the demonstrator took one route to retrieve a poster that had ostensibly fallen). Moreover, route preferences were stably maintained over multiple transmission episodes. We suggest that simple social learning processes, often neglected in human and primate research, can result in long-lived route preferences that may influence a range of additional behaviour patterns.",

The process of group fission lasted several months, beginning when the original group (Ss) reached just over 50 individuals. For both daughter groups, rates of both intragroup and intergroup aggression increased following fission. Rates of intergroup aggression were especially high immediately following fission as the two daughter groups fought frequently while establishing a new territorial border. The larger daughter group continued to use the original home range of Ss whereas the smaller daughter group shifted its home range. The displaced daughter group increased daily travel distances following group fission as they established a new territory, and no infants were born the year after fission. The members of Ss were last involved in a group fission 18 years ago, suggesting a faster rate of group fission compared to population-level estimates (one per 35 group-years). The especially high frequency of group fission relative to the rest of the population is deserving of further study.",

		"abstract": "We describe two field experiments with wild guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in Trinidad that demonstrated that guppies can acquire foraging and predator escape-response information from conspecifics. In the foraging experiment, subjects were presented with two distinctly marked feeders in their home rivers. One feeder contained a conspecific shoal in a transparent container. Guppies preferred to enter the feeder containing this artificial shoal over the other feeder. In a test phase, the artificial shoal was removed and the feeders replaced at the testing site after a 5-min delay. More guppies entered the feeder that had contained the artificial shoal over the other feeder, a difference that can be explained only by the fish learning the characteristics or location of the feeder during the training phase. We suggest that subjects acquired a foraging patch preference through a propensity to approach feeding conspecifics, a local enhancement process. In the predator escape-response experiment, naıve ‘observer’ guppies could avoid an approaching trawl net by escaping through either a hole to which ‘demonstrator’ guppies had been trained or through an alternative hole. When the demonstrators were present, the naıve observers escaped more often and more rapidly by the demonstrated route than the alternative route. When the demonstrators were removed, observers maintained a route preference according to the training of their demonstrators, which suggests that the observers had learned an escape route through following or observing their more knowledgeable conspecifics. Thus, both experiments reveal that guppies can socially learn in the wild. Copyright 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",

		"abstract": "Cultural transmission is thought to be a mechanism by which migratory animals settle into habitats, but little evidence exists in wild populations because of the difficulty of following individuals over successive generations and wide geographical distances. Cultural inheritance of migration routes represents a mechanism whereby geographical isolation can arise between separate groups and could constrain individuals to potentially suboptimal sites within their range. Conversely, adopting the parental migratory route in adult life, rather than dispersing randomly, may increase an individual’s reproductive success because that strategy has already been proven to allow successful breeding. We combined a pedigree of related light-bellied Brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) with 6 years of observations of marked birds to calculate the dispersal distances of adult offspring from their parents in both Ireland and Iceland. In both countries, the majority of offspring were found to recruit into or near their parental sites, indicating migratory connectivity in the flyway. Despite this kin structure, we found no evidence of genetic differentiation using genotype data from 1127 individuals across 15 microsatellite loci. We suggest that the existence of migratory connectivity of subpopulations is far more common than previous research indicates and that cultural information may play an important role in structuring reproductive isolation among them.",

Haplotype frequencies also differed markedly among breeding regions (overall FST = 0.093, ΦST = 0.106, p < 0.0001), providing evidence of strong natal fidelity. Although sex-biased dispersal was not evident, differentiation of microsatellite allele frequencies was weak compared to differentiation of mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting male-biased gene flow. Feeding and breeding regions showed significant differences in haplotype frequencies, even for regions known to be strongly connected by patterns of individual migration. Thus, the influence of migratory fidelity seems to operate somewhat independently on feeding and breeding grounds over an evolutionary time scale. This results in a complex population structure and the potential to define multiple units to conserve in either seasonal habitat.",

Although sex-biased dispersal was not evident, differentiation of microsatellite allele frequencies was weak compared to differentiation of mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting male-biased gene flow. Feeding and breeding regions showed significant differences in haplotype frequencies, even for regions known to be strongly connected by patterns of individual migration. Thus, the influence of migratory fidelity seems to operate somewhat independently on feeding and breeding grounds over an evolutionary time scale. This results in a complex population structure and the potential to define multiple units to conserve in either seasonal habitat.",

		"abstract": "Large home ranges and extreme flexibility in ranging behaviors characterize most subarid dwelling haplorhines. However, the most comparable extant strepsirhine, Lemur catta, is characterized as having small home ranges with consistent boundaries. Since ranging studies on this species have been limited to gallery forest habitat, the author's goal is to identify ecological factors that affect range use of L. catta in one of the most resource-limited environments of its distribution. To conduct this study, ranging and behavioral data were collected on two nonoverlapping groups through all-day follows in the semidesert scrub environment of Cap Sainte-Marie (CSM), Madagascar. Data were collected from August 2007 through July 2008. Home range areas and day range lengths were generated using ArcGIS® 9.3. Other variables measured were habitat composition, diet richness, daily activity, and microclimate. Home range areas of CSM L. catta were very large relative to those of gallery forest L. catta, and there was great monthly variation. In contrast, day range lengths at CSM were either smaller than or approximated the size of comparative gallery forest groups. Temperature, sunning, and diet richness were associated with day range length for one but not for both groups and appear to be related to energy management needs. Based on these findings, the author suggests that L. catta is capable of extensive behavioral and ranging flexibility in the extremes of its environment. However, physiological constraints impose limitations that can interfere with its ability to adapt to even seemingly minor variations in microclimate and habitat structure within the same site.

		"abstract": "In terrestrial systems, the green wave hypothesis posits that migrating animals can enhance foraging opportunities by tracking phenological variation in high-quality forage across space (i.e., “resource waves”). To track resource waves, animals may rely on proximate cues and/or memory of long-term average phenologies. Although there is growing evidence of resource tracking in terrestrial migrants, such drivers remain unevaluated in migratory marine megafauna. Here we present a test of the green wave hypothesis in a marine system. We compare 10 years of blue whale movement data with the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom resulting in increased prey availability in the California Current Ecosystem, allowing us to investigate resource tracking both contemporaneously (response to proximate cues) and based on climatological conditions (memory) during migrations. Blue whales closely tracked the long-term average phenology of the spring bloom, but did not track contemporaneous green-up. In addition, blue whale foraging locations were characterized by low long-term habitat variability and high long-term productivity compared with contemporaneous measurements. Results indicate that memory of long-term average conditions may have a previously underappreciated role in driving migratory movements of long-lived species in marine systems, and suggest that these animals may struggle to respond to rapid deviations from historical mean environmental conditions. Results further highlight that an ecological theory of migration is conserved across marine and terrestrial systems. Understanding the drivers of animal migration is critical for assessing how environmental changes will affect highly mobile fauna at a global scale.",

		"abstract": "How do migration and acculturation (i.e. psychological or behavioral change resulting from migration) affect within- and between-group cultural variation? Here I address this question by drawing analogies between genetic and cultural evolution. Population genetic models show that migration rapidly breaks down between-group genetic structure. In cultural evolution, however, migrants or their descendants can acculturate to local behaviors via social learning processes such as conformity, potentially preventing migration from eliminating between-group cultural variation. An analysis of the empirical literature on migration suggests that acculturation is common, with second and subsequent migrant generations shifting, sometimes substantially, towards the cultural values of the adopted society. Yet there is little understanding of the individual-level dynamics that underlie these population-level shifts. To explore this formally, I present models quantifying the effect of migration and acculturation on between-group cultural variation, for both neutral and costly cooperative traits. In the models, between-group cultural variation, measured using F statistics, is eliminated by migration and maintained by conformist acculturation. The extent of acculturation is determined by the strength of conformist bias and the number of demonstrators from whom individuals learn. Acculturation is countered by assortation, the tendency for individuals to preferentially interact with culturally-similar others. Unlike neutral traits, cooperative traits can additionally be maintained by payoff-biased social learning, but only in the presence of strong sanctioning mechanisms (e.g. institutions). Overall, the models show that surprisingly little conformist acculturation is required to maintain realistic amounts of between-group cultural diversity. While these models provide insight into the potential dynamics of acculturation and migration in cultural evolution, they also highlight the need for more empirical research into the individual-level learning biases that underlie migrant acculturation.",

		"abstract": "Background: Decades of research have revealed rich cultural repertoires encompassing multiple traditions in wild great apes, a picture crucially complemented by experimental simulations with captive apes. Studies with wild capuchin monkeys, the most encephalized simian species, have indicated a New World convergence on these cultural phenomena, involving multiple traditions and tool use. However, experimental studies to date are in conflict with such findings in concluding that capuchins, like other monkeys, show minimal capacities for social learning.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Here we report a new experimental approach in which the alpha male of each of two groups of capuchins was trained to open an artificial foraging device in a quite different way, using either a slide or lift action, then reunited with his group. In each group a majority of monkeys, 8 of 11 and 13 of 14, subsequently mastered the task. Seventeen of the successful 21 monkeys discovered the alternative action to that seeded in the group, performing it a median of 4 times. Nevertheless, all 21 primarily adopted the technique seeded by their group’s alpha male. Median proportions of slide versus lift were 0.96 for the group seeded with slide versus 0. 01 for the group seeded with lift.\nConclusions/Significance: These results suggest a striking effect of social conformity in learned behavioral techniques, consistent with field reports of capuchin traditions and convergent on the only other species in which such cultural phenomena have been reported, chimpanzees and humans.",

The Koshima group was first provisioned in 1952, at which point all of 22 individuals were identified. Since then, observations on all of the individually identified monkeys have been carried out. Since the average life span of a Japanese macaque is around 20 years and as most females bear their first infant between the ages of 5 and 10, several generations of monkeys have been observed on the island, all descendants of the original members. By 1999 the population on the island had risen to 450 individuals (Fig. 1), a little over half of which (57%) had reached puberty and were over 5 years of age. The Koshima group of Japanese macaques is unique in that nearly 40% of the offspring die within their first year. Such a high first year mortality may be the result of poor nutritional conditions prevailing on the island, in turn resulting from there being a large population confined to such a small island (Mori 1979; Watanabe et al. 1992).",

		"abstract": "Patterns of collective movements, such as the distribution of leadership and the organization of individuals, may be either homogeneously (no leader, no specific order), or heterogeneously (1 or several leaders, and a highly stable order) distributed. Members of a group need to synchronize their activities and coordinate their movements, despite the fact that they differ in physiological or morphological traits. The degree of difference in these traits may affect their decision-making strategy. We demonstrate how a theoretical model based on a variation of a simple mimetic rule, i.e., an amplification process, can result in each of the various collective movement patterns and decision-making strategies observed in primates and other species. We consider cases in which 1) the needs of different individuals are identical and social relationships are equivalent between group members, 2) the needs of individuals are different and social relationships are equivalent, and 3) the needs of individuals are different and social relationships are different. Finally, 4) we assess how the synergy between 2 mimetism rules, specifically the probability of joining a movement and that of canceling an initiation, allows group members to stay synchronized and cohesive. Our models suggest that similar self-organized processes have been selected as reliable and well-adapted means for optimal collective decisions across species, despite differences in their biological and social characteristics.",

		"abstract": "Although there exist advantages to group-living in comparison to a solitary lifestyle, costs and gains of group-living may be unequally distributed among group members. Predation risk, vigilance levels and food intake may be unevenly distributed across group spatial geometry and certain within-group spatial positions may be more or less advantageous depending on the spatial distribution of these factors. In species characterized with dominance hierarchy, high-ranking individuals are commonly observed in advantageous spatial position. However, in complex social systems, individuals can develop afﬁliative relationships that may balance the effect of dominance relationships in individual’s spatial distribution. The objective of the present study is to investigate how the group spatial distribution of a semi-free ranging colony of Mandrills relates to its social organization. Using spatial observations in an area surrounding the feeding zone, we tested the three following hypothesis: (1) does dominance hierarchy explain being observed in proximity or far from a food patch? (2) Do afﬁliative associations also explain being observed in proximity or far from a food patch? (3) Do the differences in rank in the group hierarchy explain being co-observed in proximity of a food patch? Our results showed that high-ranking individuals were more observed in proximity of the feeding zone while low-ranking individuals were more observed at the boundaries of the observation area. Furthermore, we observed that afﬁliative relationships were also associated with individual spatial distributions and explain more of the total variance of the spatial distribution in comparison with dominance hierarchy. Finally, we found that individuals observed at a same moment in proximity of the feeding zone were more likely to be distant in the hierarchy while controlling for maternal kinship, age and sex similarity. This study brings some elements about how afﬁliative networks and dominance hierarchy are related to spatial positions in primates.",

Group size is predicted to increase with both food density and travel capabilities, as estimated by the \"constraint-flee dayrange\" (DRs), i.e. the day-range of a solitary individual uninfluenced by competition from conspecifics. We test this \"exploitation competition\" hypothesis among primates and carnivores, using data on populations, species and genera. Food density was indexed by population density. Where DRs could be estimated by regression it was found to be correlated with observed day-range (DRm). DR~ was therefore indexed by DRm in all species. Population density and DRm were associated with each other, but in a multiple regression each variable contributed independently to explaining variation in group size. PGS was predicted better than FGS, but regressions involving either measure of group size were significant in all analyses. The multiple regression analyses were validated by the method of linear contrasts, which accounts for possible lack of independence among taxa. We conclude that species differences in group size are influenced by both food density and DRs. This suggests that variation in the intensity of exploitation competition is partly responsible for differences in group size.",

		"abstract": "Gibbons are highly territorial and have two key areas within these territories. The core area in which we find all sleeping trees and the trees from which the gibbons duet and the wider home range (HR) which has varying levels of overlap with neighbouring gibbon groups. The core area is strenously defended, with the wider HR being more of a shared area for neighbouring groups. We present ranging and movement data on four wild gibbon groups from January 2010 to July 2018. Global Positioning System (GPS) data were collected every 5 mins on habitauted groups in Sebangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia resulting in 35,521 waypoints. Gibbon home- and corerange sizes were calculated using 95%, and 50%, volume contours of kernel density estimates. Home-ranges ranged from 58.74–147.75 ha with a mean of 95.7 ± SD 37.75 ha, the highest of comparable Hylobates species. Core-range size ranged from 20.7–51.31 ha with a mean size of 31.7 ± SD 13.76 ha. Gibbons had consistant site fidelity for their home- and core ranges; percentage overlap ranged from 4.3 23.97% with a mean 16.5 ± SD 8.65% overlap in home-range area. Core ranges did not overlap with the exception of two groups, in which a 0.64 ha (2.69%) overlap occurred. Unsurprisingly forest loss from fire does affect the location of the HR of the impacted group, but does not appear to affect adjacent groups, though more data are needed on this. Understanding the complex use of space of these territorial animals is important in assessing both carrying capacity for wild populations and understading how reintroduced gibbon pairs will establish their core and HR.",

		"abstract": "Home ranging is a near-ubiquitous phenomenon in the animal kingdom. Understanding the behavioural mechanisms that give rise to observed home range patterns is thus an important general question, and mechanistic home range analysis (MHRA) provides the tools to address it. However, such analysis has hitherto been principally restricted to scent-marking territorial animals, so its potential breadth of application has not been tested. Here, we apply MHRA to a population of long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus, a non-territorial passerine, in the non-breeding season where there is no clear ‘central place’ near which birds need to remain. The aim is to uncover the principal movement mechanisms underlying observed home range formation. Our foundational models consist of memory-mediated conspecific avoidance between flocks, combined with attraction to woodland. These are then modified to incorporate the effects of flock size and relatedness (i.e. kinship), to uncover the effect of these on the mechanisms of home range formation. We found that a simple model of spatial avoidance, together with attraction to the central parts of woodland areas, accurately captures long-tailed tit home range patterns. Refining these models further, we show that the magnitude of spatial avoidance by a flock is negatively correlated to both the relative size of the flock (compared to its neighbour) and the relatedness of the flock with its neighbour. Our study applies MHRA beyond the confines of scent-marking, territorial animals, so paves the way for much broader taxonomic application. These could potentially help uncover general properties underlying the emergence of animal space use patterns. This is also the first study to apply MHRA to questions of relatedness and flock size, thus broadening the potential possible applications of this suite of analytic techniques.",

Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry – movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach – which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a uniﬁed approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.",

		"abstract": "Human warfare and intergroup aggression among primates have traditionally been considered to be largely unrelated phenomena. Recently, however, chimpanzee intergroup violence has been proposed to show evolutionary continuities with war among small-scale societies because both systems involve interactions among temporary subgroups, deliberate attempts to hunt and maim, and demographically significant death rates. Here, we ask whether the functional similarities between intergroup aggression among humans and chimpanzees can be extended to troop-living primates. In most primates, patterns of intergroup aggression involve brief encounters among stable troops, rare violence, and almost no killing. Although they, therefore, show little behavioral resemblance to warfare, growing evidence indicates that intergroup dominance is adaptively important in primates because it predicts long-term fitness. This suggests that in all primates, including humans, individuals use coalitions to maintain or expand access to resources by dominating their neighbors. Thus, while the style of coalitionary aggression depends on each species’ evolutionary ecology, we propose that the essential functional reasons for intergroup competition are consistent across group-living primates and humans: strength in numbers predicts long-term access to resources.",

		"abstract": "Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized. Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets. Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation. ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed. We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.",

		"abstract": "Group size is expected to be an important factor to predict home-range (HR) size in social animals. In chimpanzees adult males play an important role in defending the HR against neighbors, and therefore it has been suggested that HR size depends on the number of adult males. In this long-term study on wild West African chimpanzees, we analyzed the relative importance of community size and composition on ranging patterns over a 10-year period, using multivariate statistics. Because community size decreased from 51 individuals with 6 adult males in 1992 to 22 individuals with only 1 adult male in 2001, we expected a decrease in HR size, which should be better predicted by the number of males than by community size. We further investigated the effect of fruit availability on monthly HRs over a 4-year period. As predicted, HR size decreased during the ﬁrst 7 years of our study but increased during the last 3 years. Overall, the number of adult males was the best predictor of HR size, whereas fruit availability did not correlate with HR size. HR use remained stable over the entire study period, with a constant proportion of about 35% of the HR used as core area. High HR and core-area overlap values between different years indicated strong site-ﬁdelity. Although the number of males within the community explained the decrease in HR size, the recent increase in size remains unexplained.",

To understand the evolution of parallel dispersal in male primates, we explore if parallel dispersal co-occurs with male coalitions, or with other traits that may facilitate coalition formation. We conducted a meta-analysis using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for an association between male parallel dispersal and male coalition formation, multi-male social groups, male-biased dispersal, high paternity concentration, and breeding seasonality. These traits were predicted to be correlated with parallel dispersal because they increase the availability of potential dispersal partners, increase individual competitive ability, or provide inclusive ﬁtness beneﬁts for cooperating relatives. Pairwise comparisons revealed that coalitions in general were signiﬁcantly associated with male parallel dispersal. However, neither intergroup nor intragroup coalitions were associated with parallel dispersal when examined separately, though there was a trend towards signiﬁcance for intergroup coalitions. Male-biased dispersal was equivocally associated with parallel dispersal, while multi-male social groups, paternity concentration, and breeding seasonality were not. These results suggest that the evolution of male parallel dispersal may be linked with the propensity of males to form coalitions and the need to retain coalition partners.",

		"abstract": "Dunbar (1992,Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.33, 35–49) argued that constraints on social time limited the size to which savannah baboon,Papio cynocephalustroops in any given population could grow before fissioning. Since this should be reflected in population structure, we have elsewhere (Henzi et al. 1997a,Anim. Behav. 53,525–535) constructed a model, based on a rising probability of fission, that fits the observed distribution of troop sizes of mountain baboons,P.c.ursinusin the Drakensberg mountains of South Africa and which predicts that the probability of fission will rapidly increase once a troop has more than 23 members (or 8.7 females). We test this prediction in this paper. Since Dunbar argued that females will drive fission once they cannot engage in the grooming necessary to sustain alliances, we compared the grooming interactions of adult females from four troops in the Drakensberg mountains. The mean female grooming clique size reached an asymptote at 7.4 females, so that females in cohorts of eight or more no longer attempted to groom all other females, and mean grooming bout length declined as the cohort grew to 7.9 females and then increased again. These values are coincident with the female cohort size predicted by our model of troop growth and fission. We argue that females attempt to groom all other females as well as sustain closer relationships with a few females through longer bouts of reciprocated grooming. When the demands of grooming all other females reduce bout length to a point when no reciprocated bouts are possible, female clique size is capped. As a troop continues to grow, the mechanical difficulties involved in gaining access to grooming partners leads to a reduction in the diversity of grooming relationships. This weakening of the total female network, as cliques become more differentiated, is likely to facilitate fission. We conclude that our data provide the first within-population validation of Dunbar's hypothesis concerning the mechanism underpinning fission. In the Drakensberg, where there is no advantage to female coalitions, we propose, as an amendment, that females will leave a troop not to escape local competition, but to follow a male with whom they have a close friendship.",

		"abstract": "In social animals, fission is a common mode of group proliferation and dispersion and may be affected by genetic or other social factors. Sociality implies preserving relationships between group members. An increase in group size and/or in competition for food within the group can result in decrease certain social interactions between members, and the group may split irreversibly as a consequence. One individual may try to maintain bonds with a maximum of group members in order to keep group cohesion, i.e. proximity and stable relationships. However, this strategy needs time and time is often limited. In addition, previous studies have shown that whatever the group size, an individual interacts only with certain grooming partners. There, we develop a computational model to assess how dynamics of group cohesion are related to group size and to the structure of grooming relationships. Groups' sizes after simulated fission are compared to observed sizes of 40 groups of primates. Results showed that the relationship between grooming time and group size is dependent on how each individual attributes grooming time to its social partners, i.e. grooming a few number of preferred partners or grooming equally or not all partners. The number of partners seemed to be more important for the group cohesion than the grooming time itself. This structural constraint has important consequences on group sociality, as it gives the possibility of competition for grooming partners, attraction for high-ranking individuals as found in primates' groups. It could, however, also have implications when considering the cognitive capacities of primates.",

		"abstract": "Group living provides benefits to individuals while imposing costs on them. In species that live in permanent social groups, group division provides the only opportunity for nondispersing individuals to change their group membership and improve their benefit to cost ratio. We examined group choice by 81 adult female savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus) during four fission events. We measured how each female’s group choice was affected by several factors: the presence of her maternal kin, paternal kin, age peers, and close social partners, her average kinship to groupmates, and her potential for improved dominance rank. Maternal kin, paternal kin, and close social partners influenced group choice by some females, but the relative importance of these factors varied across fissions. Age peers other than paternal kin had no effect on group choice, and average kinship to all groupmates had the same effect on group choice as did maternal kin alone. Most females were subordinate to fewer females after fissions than before, but status improvement did not drive female group choice; females often preferred to remain with social superiors who were their close maternal kin, rather than improving their own social ranks. We suggest that during permanent group fissions, female baboons prefer to remain with close maternal kin if those are abundant enough to influence their fitness; if they have too few close maternal kin then females prefer to remain with close paternal kin, and social bonds with nonkin might also become influential.",

		"abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) collars have revolutionized the field of spatial ecology, but to date, few primate studies have used them. We fitted a free-ranging, semi-habituated, juvenile male chacma baboon (Papio hamadryas ursinus) with an automatic self-releasing GPS collar and tracked his movements for 359 days. The collar captured 4254 fixes out of 5719 programmed opportunities, a 74.4 % acquisition rate, suggesting that the collar effectively tracked this baboon in a variety of habitat types. Of the data points captured, 73.7 % were three-dimensional fixes, and of these fixes, 66.9 % were highly accurate, having a dilution of precision of less than four. We calculated home range using three protocols with three estimation methods: minimum convex polygon, fixed kernel-density estimation (KDE), and fixed r local convex hull. Using all data points and the 95 % contour, these methods created home range estimations ranging from 10.8 to 23.1 km2 for this baboon troop. Our results indicate that the KDE output using all data locations most accurately represented our data set, as it created a continuous home range boundary that excluded unused areas and outlying, potentially exploratory data points while including all seven sleeping sites and a movement corridor. However, home range estimations generated from KDE varied from 15.4 to 18.8 km2 depending on the smoothing parameter used. Our results demonstrated that the ad hoc smoothing parameter selection technique was a better method for our data set than either the least squares cross-validation or biased cross-validation techniques. Our results demonstrate the need for primatologists to develop a standardized reporting method which documents the tool, screening protocol, and smoothing parameter used in the creation of home range estimations in order to make comparisons that are meaningful.",

		"abstract": "Space use by animals can provide insight into the habitats in which they live. In predictable landscapes where high-quality habitat is distributed heterogeneously, fidelity can increase individual fitness because animals benefit from familiarity. We tested the hypothesis that space use and the level of site fidelity will reflect habitat productivity and the spatiotemporal distribution of resources. To test our hypothesis we examined site fidelity in 41 grizzly bears, Ursus arctos, during 2003–2006 in the Mackenzie Delta, in Canada's Arctic. We estimated annual home range size for males (x¯=1215km2) and females (x¯=680km2) using the 95% fixed kernel approach. We used three methods to examine the level of home range fidelity in consecutive years. Bear locations were largely spatially nonoverlapping between years, which represented a pattern of both low site and home range fidelity. Although distances between home range centres were small for both males (x¯=7.7km) and females (x¯=8.4km), mean percentage overlap was only 24.2%. Our observations suggest that bears remain philopatric to a region, however, position and configuration of the annual range drifts over time. The low fidelity that we observed suggests an adaptive strategy of space use for low-density populations in regions of low productivity where quality habitats are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. We suggest that traditional definitions of a home range may be too limited for Arctic grizzlies and propose that the multiannual home range is a more meaningful measure for describing space use.",

Larger groups benefit from information pooling, translating to greater ‘collective intelligence’, but face increased coordination challenges. If these facets interact, we should observe a non-linear relationship between group size and collective movement. We deployed high-resolution GPS tags to vulturine guineafowl from 21 distinct social groups and used continuous-time movement models to characterize group movements across five seasons. Our data revealed a quadratic relationship between group size and movement characteristics, with intermediate-sized groups exhibiting the largest home-range size and greater variation in space use. Intermediate-sized groups also had higher reproductive success, but having more young in the group reduced home-range size. Our study suggests the presence of an optimal group size, and composition, for collective movement.",

		"abstract": "Animal Culture\nCultural transmission of information occurs when individuals learn from others with more experience or when individuals come to accept particular modes of behavior as the local norm. Such information transfer can be expected in highly social or long-lived species where contact and time for learning are maximized and are seen in humans (see the Perspective by de Waal). Using a network-based diffusion analysis on a long-term data set that includes tens of thousands of observations of individual humpback whales, Allen et al. (p. 485) show that an innovative feeding behavior has spread through social transmission since it first emerged in a single individual in 1980. The “lobtail” feeding has passed among associating individuals for more than three decades. Van de Waal et al. (p. 483), on the other hand, used a controlled experimental approach in vervet monkeys to show that individuals learn what to eat from more experienced individuals within their social group. Not only did young animals learn from observing older animals, but immigrating males switched their food preference to that of their new group.\nConformity to local behavioral norms reflects the pervading role of culture in human life. Laboratory experiments have begun to suggest a role for conformity in animal social learning, but evidence from the wild remains circumstantial. Here, we show experimentally that wild vervet monkeys will abandon personal foraging preferences in favor of group norms new to them. Groups first learned to avoid the bitter-tasting alternative of two foods. Presentations of these options untreated months later revealed that all new infants naïve to the foods adopted maternal preferences. Males who migrated between groups where the alternative food was eaten switched to the new local norm. Such powerful effects of social learning represent a more potent force than hitherto recognized in shaping group differences among wild animals.\nA natural experiment reveals that wild vervet migrants adopt local norms when it comes to choosing foods. [Also see Perspective by de Waal]\nA natural experiment reveals that wild vervet migrants adopt local norms when it comes to choosing foods. [Also see Perspective by de Waal]",

To do so, we\n\nused the available literature to collect information on behavioral (group\n\nsize, burrow digging), ecological (amount of plant cover in the habitat), and\n\nlife history (body mass, time to sexual maturity) variables, along with\n\nphylogenetic relationships of these rodents. We analyzed these variables in\n\nthe context of three major hypotheses. A first explanation poses that rodents\n\nlive in groups to reduce the energy needed in the construction of their\n\nburrows. A second hypothesis suggests that grouped rodents increase their\n\nability to detect and escape from predators. A third possibility states that\n\ngroup-living is adopted by rodents to provide extra parental care to their\n\noffspring. Our comparative analysis revealed that across species variation of\n\ngroup size is, to some extent, influenced by body size, and by the habit of\n\nburrow digging. Thus, large sized rodent species that actively dig their own\n\nburrows form larger group sizes than small sized species that do not dig\n\nburrows. In contrast, across species variation of group size was not\n\ninfluenced by differences in the amount of plant cover in the habitat (an\n\nindirect measure of predatory risk), or by differences in the time to first\n\nreproduction (a measure of parental care given). Therefore, group-living among\n\nthe New World histricognath rodents seems more linked to a strategy aimed to\n\nreduce their burrowing cost than to a strategy aimed to reduce their predatory\n\nrisk, or to extend their parental investment.",

Groups with a high degree of FFD split into subgroups that vary in size, cohesion and composition, often within short temporal scales. These dynamics are thought to be more complex than those of other species with cohesive, stable groups, leading to hypotheses about the origin of social intelligence. Also, a flexible grouping pattern is supposed to be an adaptive solution to the temporal and spatial variation in feeding resources. We have used models where relatively simple agents forage in realistic, heterogenous environments and have shown that, for intermediate levels of heterogeneity in the size of food patches, agents form subgroups that vary in size and composition in a similar fashion as they do in species with a high degree of FFD. We have also explored the idea that by splitting in subgroups that vary in size, animals can exploit a heterogeneous environment with ephemeral food sources more efficiently than cohesive groups. Agent-based models have provided ways to test hypotheses and develop predictions about social and ecological dynamics.",

I use three lines of evidence to develop predictions as to how male and femaleC. capucinus interact and how the sexes differ in behavior: (1) phylogenetic similarities to other species ofCebus; (2) a general model of sex differences in female-bonded social systems; and (3) ecological analogy of Old World monkeys. First, I conclude that phylogenetic affinity is a good predictor in thatC. capucinus are similar to other species ofCebus in many patterns of sex-differentiated behavior. An exception is that, unlikeC. apella andC. olivaceus, in which a single breeding male is reported to be highly conspicuous in each group,C. capucinus live in a decidedly multimale system. Secondly, the general model of sex differences in female philopatric, male-dispersal societies, which was originally developed for Old World species, also accurately predicts several aspects of social behavior inC. capucinus. Thirdly, a proposed ecological analogy betweenCercopithecus ascanius andspecies of Cebus is not substantiated in this study of C. capucinus, though the analogy is apparently well suited to the social dynamics of other species in the genusCebus.",

		"abstract": "During the period from June to July 1983, the Hanyama-A troop of wild non-provisioned Japanese monkeys on Yakushima Island began to show signs of troop fission. Adult females together with their infants and juveniles subdivided into two groups, the Hanyama-K group and Hanyama-M group. After the subdivision, all of the troop males were observed vacillating between these two female groups. During the mating season, non-troop males were also observed moving around the two female groups. After this mating season, one of these non-troop males was found to have entered and become the alpha male in one of the groups, while higher-ranking adult males of the original troop settled into the other group. Each fissioned group was strongly considered to be composed of either high-ranking matrilines or low-ranking matrilines as observed previously in provisioned troops. The dominance relation between the two fissioned groups indicated that dominance rank reversal between these two female kin groups must have occurred during the course of subdivision of the troop. However, different from most previous cases of troop fission, there was no indication that males ever participated in the subdivision of the original female group. This was disrupted not as a result of males' involvement, but only as a result of antagonism among females, which initiated the troop fission. The main factor which appeared to determine when and in which fission group males eventually settled was the competition between the troop males' coalition and non-troop males and their ability to monopolize females. The present process of troop fission suggests a dual strategy between males and females (WRANGHAM,1979, 1980) even in the society of Japanese macaques.",

		"abstract": "Documenting inbreeding and its potential costs in wild populations is a complicated matter. Early infant death before genetic samples can be collected limits the ability of researchers to measure fitness costs, and pedigree information is necessary to accurately estimate relatedness between breeding individuals. Using data from 25 years of research from the Lomas Barbudal Capuchin Monkey Project, and a sample of 109 females that have given birth, we find that despite frequent co-residency of adult opposite-sexed individuals, capuchins produce offspring with close kin (i.e., related at the halfsibling level or higher) less often than would be expected in the absence of inbreeding avoidance. We do not find support for alternative, non-behavioral explanations for this pattern and thus argue for mate choice. Furthermore, we find evidence for fitness costs among inbred animals in the form of delayed female age at first birth but not significantly higher juvenile mortality. Further research is necessary in order to determine the mechanisms by which individuals develop sexual aversion to close kin. Through a combination of demographic records, maternal pedigrees, and genetically determined paternity, this study provides a detailed study of inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in a well-studied mammal population. This study provides (1) evidence that capuchin monkeys avoid mating with close kin at both the level of parent-offspring and half sibling and (2) evidence of fitness costs to inbreeding in the form of delayed first age at reproduction.",

		"abstract": "Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation is a primary driver of species endangerment across the globe and has compounding effects on species diversity and ecosystem function. While efforts to enhance habitat connectivity are therefore essential to protecting biodiversity, a fundamental behavioral and ecological understanding of animal movement is first needed to successfully protect species movements. Understanding the role of behavior in determining animal movement patterns is essential to conservation planning, yet the extent to which an animal’s behavioral state (e.g. foraging, dispersing) influences its movements and resource selection has largely been ignored as part of conservation planning efforts. Further, because empirical studies of animal movement are most-often site- and species-specific, the processes underlying observed movement patterns are not well understood across taxa. This dissertation seeks to elucidate the processes that shape animal movements to advance the biological grounding of connectivity science and inform conservation efforts. A systematic review of connectivity studies employing resource selection analysis examined how researchers have incorporated animal behavior into connectivity planning, and highlighted promising approaches for identifying wildlife corridors. The review revealed that most of the research done to date has superficially considered all animal location data as representative of resource selection patterns, despite recognition that an animal’s behavioral state can be an important component of space use. Those studies in the review that validated connectivity predictions with independent movement data indicate that general patterns of resource selection are not always a suitable proxy for movement preference during dispersal, and failure to recognize this distinction may have important consequences for species-specific efforts to preserve habitat connectivity. Using high-resolution GPS and activity data from African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), an Endangered species highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation, resource selection and responses to roads were measured across three behavioral states identified from activity data (hunting, resting, and traveling). The response of wild dogs to roads varied markedly with both the behavioral and landscape contexts in which roads were encountered, ranging between strong selection for and avoidance of roads depending on behavioral state. A comparison of these outputs to a full model that did not parse for behavior revealed that these patterns were not evident when all movement data were considered together in the full model. This study indicates that including behavioral information in resource selection models is critical to understanding wildlife responses to landscape features and suggests that successful application of resource selection analyses to conservation planning requires explicit examination of the behavioral contexts in which movement occurs. The effects of behaviorally-mediated patterns of resource selection were then applied in a habitat connectivity modeling context. To illustrate the importance of behavioral information in connectivity assessments, behavior-specific predictions of connectivity were tested against long-distance dispersal movements of African wild dogs. Findings demonstrated that including only directed-movement behavior when measuring resource selection reveals far more accurate patterns of habitat connectivity than a model measuring resource selection independent of behavioral state. Results of this work suggest that connectivity studies that rely on resource selection analysis alone may be insufficient to target movement pathways and corridors for protection. This research highlights the value of incorporating animal behavior into connectivity planning.To examine how basic movement processes scale up to produce emergent patterns for multiple species, movement data from over a dozen marine and terrestrial vertebrate species spanning three taxonomic classes, continents and orders of magnitude in body size were compared with computer-simulated idealized movement paths. This comparative approach revealed that similar movement patterns and properties recur in highly dissimilar ecological systems, and showed that a simple set of metrics can reliably classify broad-scale movement patterns such as migration, nomadism, and territoriality in disparate taxa. This classification system can be applied to inform predictions in multiple areas of ecological research, such as how an individual or species’ movement classification influences its response to climate change or its invasion potential in an exotic environment. In addition, this work provides researchers with a standardized set of movement metrics for expediently analyzing animal trajectories over time to detect any changes in movement pattern that may be indicative of environmental change. Taken together, the body of work presented in this dissertation provides new approaches for researchers and practitioners to understand the ecology and conservation of animal movement, and in particular for measuring wildlife responses to widespread habitat alteration. Given limited conservation resources and rapidly changing environments, these contributions mark a key step in developing effective strategies to preserve critical wildlife movement processes.",

Animal migrations are expected to enhance the global spread of pathogens and facilitate cross-species transmission. This does happen, but new research has also shown that migration allows hosts to escape from infected habitats, reduces disease levels when infected animals do not migrate successfully, and may lead to the evolution of less-virulent pathogens. Migratory demands can also reduce immune function, with consequences for host susceptibility and mortality. Studies of pathogen dynamics in migratory species and how these will respond to global change are urgently needed to predict future disease risks for wildlife and humans alike.",

There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when, and why species move. The ﬁeld of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are ﬂexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may beneﬁt by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains ﬁve steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these ﬁve steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.",

		"abstract": "Solitary bees are known to be important pollinators of seasonal dry forest plants in Costa Rica. Recent assessments of the genus Centris (family Anthophoridae) and other solitary bee taxa indicate that populations of these bees have declined by 85-90 percent in this forest over the past 20 yr. Deforestation, wildfires, and conversion of forest land to agriculture are the main reasons for the decline. From 1987 to 1991 we studied the preferred nesting habitats of seven Centris species that specialize in making their nests in preexisting holes in dead trees. Special wooden sampling units, with preexisting standardized holes, were systematically placed in several habitat types in the Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Guanacaste Province. Female bees encountered the holes as they searched for natural holes for nesting. Systematic monitoring of the units over five years, 1987 to 1991, provided a quantitative measure of habitat preference and changes in bee frequency through time. There were sufficient data for statistical analysis of three of the seven species (Centris nitida. C. bicornuta and C. analis). The closed oak forest was the predominantly preferred habitat for the three common Centris species, and this pattern remained constant through time. At least one species (C. nitida) apparently had less strict habitat requirements as it was commonly found nesting in a wide variety of habitat types. Significant increases and decreases in frequencies for individual species through time were recorded; however, there was no significant change in overall bee numbers through time. Results of the analysis, together with a qualitative assessment of the rare Centris species, suggest that the dry forest is actually a mosaic of preferred nesting sites, with each species having specific preferences. This pattern is consistent with other Centris species that have been studied in Costa Rica. The preference for oak forests is significant and suggests that more of this type of habitat should be conserved for Centris refugia.",

		"abstract": "Within comparative psychology, the evolution of animal cognition is typically studied either by comparing indirect measures of cognitive abilities (e.g., relative brain size) across many species or by conducting batteries of decision-making experiments among (typically) a few captive species. Here, we propose a third, complementary approach: inferring and comparing cognitive abilities through observational ﬁeld records of natural information gradients and the associated variation in decision-making outcomes, using the ranging behavior of wild animals. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we present the results of a global survey assessing the availability of long-term ranging data sets from wild primates and the willingness of primatologists to share such data. We explore three ways in which such ranging data, with or without the associated behavioral and ecological data often collected by primatologists, might be used to infer and compare spatial cognition. Finally, we suggest how ecological complexity may be best incorporated into comparative analyses.",

It is determined, mainly, by the amount of energy expended by the species, and, therefore, the home range area may vary according to the direct and indirect influences of weather and climate on the animal. But the kind of food that is utilized will also influence home range size. Those species that must hunt for their food need larger areas for food gathering than those species that feed on the vegetation. As a result the largest hunters appear to have their food habits regulated by considerations of the efficient use of the food materials in their home range. Finally, the home range size affects population density, which in turn influences the behavior in the population.",

		"abstract": "Relationships between neighboring groups feature prominently in socioecological theory, but few empirical studies have focused on the effects of neighbors on the behavior of primates. Interactions between neighboring groups are most conspicuous during intergroup encounters, but the likelihood of encounters with neighbors can also affect ranging and activity patterns indirectly, and, as a result, behavioral patterns in areas of exclusive use may differ from those in overlap areas of adjacent home ranges. The aim of this study was to examine intergroup relations and spatial variation in home range use in Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) during the annual mating season. Based on 230 hr of focal animal data collected from ten members of five adjacent groups, we found that behavioral patterns and patterns of resource utilization were not markedly different between areas of exclusive use and overlap areas of adjacent home ranges. Group cohesion tended to be higher in overlap than in core areas, but the proportion of time spent resting and foraging did not differ between these two areas. However, dominant males exhibited a higher scent-marking rate in overlap areas. Observations during intergroup encounters revealed that chases between males occurred frequently, whereas fights involving physical contact were not observed. We also found that the intergroup dominance hierarchy depended on the relative group size or the number of males in each group, with groups of lower dominance rank exhibiting a tendency to sleep proportionally more often in their core areas. The results of this study suggest that in primate species with a moderate level of intergroup aggression, such as Verreaux's sifaka, the possibility of encountering neighbors in areas of home range overlap does not exert strong influence on their behavior and resource utilization.",

Using location data from 1998 to 2017, we investigated within- and between-group competition in 12 groups of wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). As within-group feeding competition is expected to increase with group size, an increase in group size is predicted to lead to an increase in the size of annual home ranges and core areas, but to a decrease in fidelity (reuse of an area). Due to asymmetries in competitive abilities, larger groups are expected to have higher exclusivity (degree of non-shared space) of annual home ranges and core areas than smaller groups.",

		"abstract": "Choosing suitable sleeping sites is a common challenge faced by animals across a range of taxa, with important implications for the space usage patterns of individuals, groups, and ultimately populations. A range of factors may affect these decisions, including access to resources nearby, shelter from the elements, safety from predators, territorial defense, and protection of offspring. We investigated the factors driving patterns of sleeping site use in wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), a cooperatively breeding, territorial mongoose species that forages on scattered resources and makes use of multiple sleeping sites (burrows). We found that meerkat groups used some burrows much more often than others. In particular, large burrows near the center of the territory were used more often than small and peripheral burrows, and groups became even more biased toward central burrows when rearing pups. Meerkats also used their sleeping burrows in a nonrandom order. When they changed sleeping burrows, they moved disproportionately to nearby burrows but did not always select the closest burrow. Burrow decisions also reflected responses to short-term conditions: rates of switching burrows increased after encounters with predators and when resources were depleted, whereas group splits were associated with a reduced probability of switching. The group’s dominant female appeared to have disproportionate influence over burrow decisions, as groups were more likely to switch burrows when her foraging success was low. Our results link behavioral and movement ecology to show that a multitude of environmental and social factors shape daily group decisions of where to spend the night.",

		"abstract": "Territoriality and stable home ranges are a common space-use pattern among animals. These ranges provide its inhabitants with important resources and thus favourable territories are associated with an increased fitness. While the role of territory quality and changes of territory ownership have often been investigated, the changes of territorial boundaries have been less studied. Here, we investigated space-use changes in a social mammal species, applying a novel analytical approach, calculating long-term dissimilarity in space use using distancematrices based on periodic utilization distributions. This approach makes it possible to identify different space-use patterns, which cannot be distinguished by only considering changes between consecutive time periods. We analysed meerkat (Suricata suricatta) movements of a total of 24 different groups over a 16-year period, resulting in 134 group years. We then correlated the identified home-range changes to life-history events and possible environmental drivers. Groups had stable territories for several years before they abandoned their home range mostly to move quickly to new areas where they again remained for several years. Of 26 identified sudden shifts, 22 occurred in the summer months and often involved distances larger than the original home-range size. Home-range movements that were close together in time were often also spatially clustered and moved in a similar direction. These shifts were often preceded by more frequent interactions between groups, but did not seem to be a product of direct displacements by other groups. The normalized difference vegetation index as a measure of food production and social factors such as dominance changes did not correlate to changes. Against our expectation space-use changes were not accumulations of small changes, but more often involved long-distance moves into unknown ranges. This means that the groups enter areas where they cannot profit from local knowledge. The methods used identify episodes of long stability alternated by sudden changes in meerkats and in general provides insight into long-term space use. Our methods can be used to analyse long-term space use, either within or across species.",

		"abstract": "Ecologists have long been interested in linking individual behavior with higher-level processes. For motile species, this ‘upscaling’ is governed by how well any given movement strategy maximizes encounters with positive factors, and minimizes encounters with negative factors. Despite the importance of encounter events for a broad range of ecological processes, encounter theory has not kept pace with developments in animal tracking or movement modeling. Furthermore, existing work has focused primarily on the relationship between animal movement and encounter rates while the relationship between individual movement and the spatial locations of encounter events in the environment has remained conspicuously understudied. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a method for describing the long-term encounter location probabilities for movement within home ranges, termed the conditional distribution of encounters (CDE). We then derive this distribution, as well as confidence intervals, implement its statistical estimator into open source software, and demonstrate the broad ecological relevance of this distribution. We first use simulated data to show how our estimator provides asymptotically consistent estimates. We then demonstrate the general utility of this method for three simulation-based scenarios that occur routinely in biological systems: i) a population of individuals with home ranges that overlap with neighbors; ii) a pair of individuals with a hard territorial border between their home ranges; and iii) a predator with a large home range that encompassed the home ranges of multiple prey individuals. Using GPS data from white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) tracked on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) tracked in Bundey, South Australia, we then show how the CDE can be used to estimate the locations of territorial borders, identify key resources, quantify the potential for competitive or predatory interactions, and/or identify any changes in behaviour that directly result from location-specific encounter probability. The CDE enables researchers to better understand the dynamics of populations of interacting individuals. Notably, the general estimation framework developed in this work builds straightforwardly off of home range estimation and requires no specialised data collection protocols. This method is now openly available via the ctmm R package.",

		"abstract": "The concept of an animal’s home range has evolved over time, as have methods for estimating home-range size and shape. Recently, home-range estimation methods have focused on estimating an animal’s utilization distribution (UD; i.e., the probability distribution defining the animal’s use of space). We illustrate the importance of the utilization distribution in characterizing the degree of overlap between home ranges (e.g., when assessing site fidelity or space-use sharing among individuals). We compare several different statistics for their ability to accurately rank paired examples in terms of their degree of overlap. These examples illustrate limitations of indices commonly used to quantify home-range overlap and suggest that new overlap indices that are a function of the UD are likely to be more informative. We suggest 2 new statistics for measuring home-range overlap: (1) for a measure of spaceuse sharing, we suggest a generalization of Hurlbert’s (1978) E/Euniform statistic, which we term the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), and (2) for a general measure of similarity between UD estimates, we suggest Bhattacharyya’s affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943). Using a short simulation study, we found that overlap indices can accurately rank pairs of UDs in terms of the extent of overlap, but estimates of overlap indices are likely to be biased. The extent of the bias depended on sample size and the degree of overlap (UDs with a high degree of overlap resulted in statistics that were more biased [low]), suggesting that comparisons across studies may be problematic. We illustrate the use of overlap indices to quantify the degree of similarity among UD estimates obtained using 2 different data collection methods (Global Positioning Systems [GPS] and very high frequency [VHF] radiotelemetry) for an adult female northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in north-central Minnesota.",

		"abstract": "Individuals in groups, whether composed of humans or other animal species, often make important decisions collectively, including avoiding predators, selecting a direction in which to migrate and electing political leaders. Theoretical and empirical work suggests that collective decisions can be more accurate than individual decisions, a phenomenon known as the ‘wisdom of crowds’. In these previous studies, it has been assumed that individuals make independent estimates based on a single environmental cue. In the real world, however, most cues exhibit some spatial and temporal correlation, and consequently, the sensory information that near neighbours detect will also be, to some degree, correlated. Furthermore, it may be rare for an environment to contain only a single informative cue, with multiple cues being the norm. We demonstrate, using two simple models, that taking this natural complexity into account considerably alters the relationship between group size and decision-making accuracy. In only a minority of environments do we observe the typical wisdom of crowds phenomenon (whereby collective accuracy increases monotonically with group size). When the wisdom of crowds is not observed, we find that a finite, and often small, group size maximizes decision accuracy. We reveal that, counterintuitively, it is the noise inherent in these small groups that enhances their accuracy, allowing individuals in such groups to avoid the detrimental effects of correlated information while exploiting the benefits of collective decision-making. Our results demonstrate that the conventional view of the wisdom of crowds may not be informative in complex and realistic environments, and that being in small groups can maximize decision accuracy across many contexts.",

		"abstract": "Wildlife tourism is proliferating worldwide and has the potential to raise revenue for conservation as well as public awareness of conservation issues. However, concerns are growing about the potentially negative influence of such tourism on the wildlife involved. We investigate the effects of habituation, ecotourism and research activities on levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCMs), a proxy for physiological stress, in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic. We compare FGCMs in three human-contacted groups with those in unhabituated gorillas. We also explore how human–gorilla contact influences FGCMs of a gorilla group undergoing habituation and investigate how measures of general human–gorilla contact, tourism and human proximity influence FGCMs in recently and long-term habituated groups. Two of the three human-contacted groups had higher levels of FGCMs than unhabituated gorillas. The group undergoing habituation had the highest FGCMs, which increased up to 21days following contacts, suggesting a cumulative FGCM response, in line with descriptions of a hormonal adaptation response to a chronic intermittent stressor. FGCMs in habituated groups were significantly associated with increasing frequency of violation of the 7m distance rule by observers and with a medical intervention but not with other measures of human pressure. Our findings provide critical information for the management of this, and other, species whose conservation depends on habituation for ecotourism.",

		"abstract": "The last part of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) habituation process of the Taï South Group was monitored over 2 years (1994–1996), during which all males and most of the females became habituated to observation by humans. The time needed (5–7 years) to habituate the community was similar to that recorded for the Taï North Group and is comparable to other populations studied in Africa. Variation emerged in habituation rate: males were habituated earlier than females, and among females, sexually cycling individuals were habituated faster than non-cycling females. Such differences may be a function of both the methods used to find the chimpanzees and the sex of the individual. Reproductive status and individuality may also have influenced habituation rates by affecting the number of contacts required to habituate a chimpanzee to neutral humans.",

		"abstract": "While the process of habituation is essential for researchers to observe primates in their natural habitats, ethical dilemmas may arise from its consequences. We collected data from 286 participants via an online survey to investigate: (a) how primatologists perceive their ethical duties toward their subjects; (b) the extent to which primatologists are concerned about the potential ethical consequences of habituation; and (c) the methods primatologists use to reduce potential harms caused by habituation. Overall, primatologists felt an extremely strong duty to mitigate harms that they may cause (e.g., to not stress individuals during observation, treat injuries, and reunite separated individuals) and expressed very high concern for habituation's potential to increase the vulnerability of their subjects to poaching and disease transfer. Ratings for those items were so high that they could not be included in subsequent exploratory factor analyses that were designed to reveal constructs underlying respondents' ratings of their ethical duties and concerns. Factor analysis of ratings of ethical duties revealed that primatologists reported a strong duty to mitigate harms caused by other humans and a lower perceived duty to mitigate naturally occurring harmful events. Factor analysis on ethical concern ratings revealed that respondents were concerned about harms during the habituation process, the presence of unhabituated behavior after habituation had been established, and indirect harms of habituation. Concerns for unhabituated behavior and indirect harms were rated slightly higher than concern for harms during the habituation process. To mitigate potential harms, primatologists primarily reported engaging in strategies to reduce stress in their subjects. Our findings reveal a disconnect between primatologists' ratings of their ethical concerns and their reported mitigation practices that may, in part, stem from gaps in knowledge about the true impacts of habituation. We suggest areas of discussion and research in the field necessary to address those gaps.",

		"abstract": "Long-term monitoring is an essential component of primate conservation, and much of this research is explicitly concerned with how primates respond to and cope with diverse forms of environmental change. Here, I synthesize over four decades of data on environmental change in the Santa Rosa sector the Costa Rica’s Área de Conservación Guanacaste, to stimulate new research on the impacts of environmental change beyond seasonality on Santa Rosa’s primates. Focusing on climate variables and landscape-scale vegetation phenology, I describe and quantify typical seasonal patterns, interannual variability, and long-term trends. Santa Rosa’s highly seasonal rainfall patterns show marked interannual variability that is largely driven by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The wettest and driest periods on record have occurred in association with powerful cold ENSO episodes (La Niña) and warm ENSO episodes (El Niño), respectively. Start dates for the wet season can vary by 40 days, but no long-term linear trend was evident in the wet season start dates or in total annual rainfall. Temperature anomalies in Santa Rosa are also strongly associated with ENSO conditions over a backdrop of long-term warming. The annual cycle of plant phenology is dominated by large-scale leaf shedding during the long dry season. The timing and degree of seasonal phenological peaks show complex relationships with rainfall. Long-term data, in combination with the site’s natural environmental variability, provide uniquely quantitative context for understanding primate adaptations to changing environments – a framework that can be extended to ecological forecasting under future environmental change.",

		"abstract": "The ability of sheep to remember the spatial location of food patches was examined in two experiments. In the first experiment, patches (plastic bowls) were laid out on a grass field and some of the patches were randomly assigned to contain food (sheep pellets). Individual sheep were released into the field on a number of occasions and on each occasion the number of patches visited until all the patches that contained food had been located was recorded. Sheep were tested at three levels of complexity: one food patch among eight total patches laid out in a horizontal array; two food patches among 16 total patches laid out in a 8 × 2 grid; four food patches among 32 total patches laid out in a 8 × 4 grid. All patches were 5 m apart. Twenty sheep were tested in the one in eight level and ten sheep in the two more complex levels. At all levels of complexity, sheep returned to the patches that contained food, 12 h after first exposure, at a level better than that expected if they had searched at random. After six exposures to the distribution of patches, at 12 h intervals, sheep visited the food patches almost exclusively. The performance of the sheep did not decline when the time between successive visits was increased to 72 h. In the second experiment, individual sheep searched for one patch that contained food among eight total patches laid in a horizontal array on a grass field. Ten animals were tested with a cue (turf of white clover) located behind the food patch, and ten animals without. A wire mesh cage was placed over the top of the cue so that it could be seen and smelled, but not eaten. Sheep learned the location of the food patch with and without cues, but learned faster when a cue was present. When the location of the cue and food patch was switched randomly between trials, the sheep used spatial memory first and went to where the food patch had previously been located, but on finding no food used associations between the cue and food patch to go to the new food patch location. The ability to use spatial memory and associations between cues and rewards would help sheep to increase the rate at which they encounter preferred food patches, and to exploit spatial heterogeneity in the food resource better.",

Longitudinal studies of wild populations can document such changes in behavioural propensities, providing critical information about the contexts in which learning strategies develop, in environments similar to those in which learning strategies evolved. The Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project provides developmental data for the white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus, a species that has converged with humans regarding many life-history and behavioural characteristics. In this dataset, focused primarily on learned aspects of foraging behaviour, younger capuchins are more active overall, more curious and opportunistic, and more prone to inventing new investigative and foraging-related behaviours. Younger individuals more often seek social information by watching other foragers (especially older foragers). Younger individuals are more creative, playful and inventive, and less neophobic, exhibiting a wider range of behaviours when engaged in extractive foraging. Whereas adults more often stick with old solutions, younger individuals often incorporate recently acquired experience (both social and asocial) when foraging.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.",

		"abstract": "Choosing suitable sleeping sites is a common challenge faced by animals across a range of taxa, with important implications for the space usage patterns of individuals, groups, and ultimately populations. A range of factors may affect these decisions, including access to resources nearby, shelter from the elements, safety from predators, territorial defense, and protection of offspring. We investigated the factors driving patterns of sleeping site use in wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), a cooperatively breeding, territorial mongoose species that forages on scattered resources and makes use of multiple sleeping sites (burrows). We found that meerkat groups used some burrows much more often than others. In particular, large burrows near the center of the territory were used more often than small and peripheral burrows, and groups became even more biased toward central burrows when rearing pups. Meerkats also used their sleeping burrows in a nonrandom order. When they changed sleeping burrows, they moved disproportionately to nearby burrows but did not always select the closest burrow. Burrow decisions also reflected responses to short-term conditions: rates of switching burrows increased after encounters with predators and when resources were depleted, whereas group splits were associated with a reduced probability of switching. The group’s dominant female appeared to have disproportionate influence over burrow decisions, as groups were more likely to switch burrows when her foraging success was low. Our results link behavioral and movement ecology to show that a multitude of environmental and social factors shape daily group decisions of where to spend the night.",

		"abstract": "The concept of an animal’s home range has evolved over time, as have methods for estimating home-range size and shape. Recently, home-range estimation methods have focused on estimating an animal’s utilization distribution (UD; i.e., the probability distribution defining the animal’s use of space). We illustrate the importance of the utilization distribution in characterizing the degree of overlap between home ranges (e.g., when assessing site fidelity or space-use sharing among individuals). We compare several different statistics for their ability to accurately rank paired examples in terms of their degree of overlap. These examples illustrate limitations of indices commonly used to quantify home-range overlap and suggest that new overlap indices that are a function of the UD are likely to be more informative. We suggest 2 new statistics for measuring home-range overlap: (1) for a measure of spaceuse sharing, we suggest a generalization of Hurlbert’s (1978) E/Euniform statistic, which we term the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), and (2) for a general measure of similarity between UD estimates, we suggest Bhattacharyya’s affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943). Using a short simulation study, we found that overlap indices can accurately rank pairs of UDs in terms of the extent of overlap, but estimates of overlap indices are likely to be biased. The extent of the bias depended on sample size and the degree of overlap (UDs with a high degree of overlap resulted in statistics that were more biased [low]), suggesting that comparisons across studies may be problematic. We illustrate the use of overlap indices to quantify the degree of similarity among UD estimates obtained using 2 different data collection methods (Global Positioning Systems [GPS] and very high frequency [VHF] radiotelemetry) for an adult female northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in north-central Minnesota.",

		"abstract": "Minimum convex polygons (convex hulls) are an internationally accepted, standard method for estimating species’ ranges, particularly in circumstances in which presence-only data are the only kind of spatially explicit data available. One of their main strengths is their simplicity. They are used to make area statements and to assess trends in occupied habitat, and are an important part of the assessment of the conservation status of species. We show by simulation that these estimates are biased. The bias increases with sample size, and is affected by the underlying shape of the species habitat, the magnitude of errors in locations, and the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort. The errors affect both area statements and estimates of trends. Some of these errors may be reduced through the application of αhulls, which are generalizations of convex hulls, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. α-hulls provide an explicit means for excluding discontinuities within a species range. Strengths and weaknesses of alternatives including kernel estimators were examined. Convex hulls exhibit larger bias than α-hulls when used to quantify habitat extent and to detect changes in range, and when subject to differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort and spatial accuracy. α-hulls should be preferred for estimating the extent of and trends in species’ ranges.",

		"abstract": "The factors that drive within-species variation in animal space use remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence suggests that both home range attributes and biological interpretations of the home range may depend fundamentally on the scale of analysis. We utilize a multiscale mixed effects modelling framework to examine how seasonal fluctuations in climate, food resource abundance and group mass affect variance in home range area and the maturity stage of forest used by a group-living Neotropical primate, the white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus. Using an 8-year data set representing over 20 000 contact hours, we estimated home ranges for seven social groups at four nested temporal scales and three nested spatial scales using a movement-based kernel method. Group mass was consistently the most important predictor of home range size in our models, and its effects were relatively insensitive to spatial or temporal scale. Mean daily maximum temperature was an influential factor in shaping monthly range area and composition, with hotter weather favouring smaller home range size and increased use of mature evergreen forest. Greater fruit availability was also associated with smaller monthly range area. The effects of temperature and fruit availability were both scale dependent: the impact of both variables was greatest on the core zone. The different study groups showed marked variation in the habitat composition of their home ranges, but in all groups, higher-use zones consisted of older, more evergreen forest. Our study illustrates the complex ecological processes that affect movement behaviour in a Neotropical primate across a range of spatial and temporal scales, highlighting the importance of group mass, climatic seasonality, landscape heterogeneity and dietary shifts in shaping the home range.",

		"abstract": "Movement is fundamental to life, shaping population dynamics, biodiversity patterns, and ecosystem structure. Recent advances in tracking technology have enabled fundamental questions about movement to be tackled, leading to the development of the movement ecology framework (MEF), considered a milestone in the field [1]. The MEF introduced an integrative theory of organismal movement, linking internal state, motion capacity and navigation capacity to external factors. Here, a decade later, we investigated the current state of research in the field. Using a text mining approach on >8000 peer-reviewed papers in movement ecology, we explored the main research topics, evaluated the impact of the MEF, and assessed changes in the use of technological devices, software and statistical methods. The number of publications has increased considerably and there have been major technological changes in the past decade (i.e.~increased use of GPS devices, accelerometers and video cameras, and a convergence towards R), yet we found that research focuses on the same questions, specifically, on the effect of environmental factors on movement and behavior. In practice, it appears that movement ecology research does not reflect the MEF. We call on researchers to transform the field from technology-driven to embrace interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to reveal key processes underlying movement (e.g.~navigation), as well as evolutionary, physiological and life-history consequences of particular strategies.",

		"abstract": "Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: “fixed sphere-of-influence,” or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an “adaptive sphere-of-influence,” or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original “fixed-number-of-points,” or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu).",

		"abstract": "1. The recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) has advantages over traditional methods because it quantifies the utilization distribution of an animal based on its movement path rather than individual points and accounts for temporal autocorrelation and high data volumes. However, the BBMM assumes unrealistic homogeneous movement behaviour across all data. 2. Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the BBMM by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current BBMM as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5. This new method provides a more accurate utilization distribution that better describes the space use of realistic, behaviourally heterogeneous tracks.",

		"abstract": "An animal’s trajectory is a fundamental object of interest in movement ecology, as it directly informs a range of topics from resource selection to energy expenditure and behavioral states. Optimally inferring the mostly unobserved movement path and its dynamics from a limited sample of telemetry observations is a key unsolved problem, however. The field of geostatistics has focused significant attention on a mathematically analogous problem that has a statistically optimal solution coined after its inventor, Krige. Kriging revolutionized geostatistics and is now the gold standard for interpolating between a limited number of autocorrelated spatial point observations. Here we translate Kriging for use with animal movement data. Our Kriging formalism encompasses previous methods to estimate animal’s trajectories—the Brownian bridge and continuous-time correlated random walk library—as special cases, informs users as to when these previous methods are appropriate, and provides a more general method when they are not. We demonstrate the capabilities of Kriging on a case study with Mongolian gazelles where, compared to the Brownian bridge, Kriging with a more optimal model was 10% more precise in interpolating locations and 500% more precise in estimating occurrence areas.",

		"abstract": "Cognition, defined as the processes concerned with the acquisition, retention and use of information, underlies animals’ abilities to navigate their local surroundings, embark on long-distance seasonal migrations, and socially learn information relevant to movement. Hence, in order to fully understand and predict animal movement, researchers must know the cognitive mechanisms that generate such movement. Work on a few model systems indicates that most animals possess excellent spatial learning and memory abilities, meaning that they can acquire and later recall information about distances and directions among relevant objects. Similarly, field work on several species has revealed some of the mechanisms that enable them to navigate over distances of up to several thousand kilometers. Key behaviors related to movement such as the choice of nest location, home range location and migration route are often affected by parents and other conspecifics. In some species, such social influence leads to the formation of aggregations, which in turn may lead to further social learning about food locations or other resources. Throughout the review, we note a variety of topics at the interface of cognition and movement that invite further investigation. These include the use of social information embedded in trails, the likely important roles of soundscapes and smellscapes, the mechanisms that large mammals rely on for long-distance migration, and the effects of expertise acquired over extended periods.",

The Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimation (AKDE) family of estimators were designed to be statistically efficient while explicitly dealing with the complexities of modern movement data: autocorrelation, small sample sizes, and missing or irregularly sampled data. Although each of these estimators has been described in separate technical papers, here we review how these estimators work and provide a user-friendly guide on how they may be combined to reduce multiple biases simultaneously. 3. We describe the magnitude of the improvements offered by these estimators and their impact on home range area estimates, using both empirical case studies and simulations, contrasting their computational costs.4.

		"abstract": "Estimating animal home ranges is a primary purpose of collecting tracking data. Many widely used home range estimators, including conventional kernel density estimators, assume independently-sampled data. In stark contrast, modern animal tracking datasets are almost always strongly autocorrelated. The incongruence between estimator assumptions and empirical reality often leads to systematically underestimated home ranges. Autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) directly models the observed autocorrelation structure of tracking data during home range estimation, and has been shown to perform accurately across a broad range of tracking datasets. However, compared to conventional estimators, AKDE requires additional modeling steps and has heretofore only been accessible via the command-line ctmm R package. Here, we introduce ctmmweb, which provides a point-and-click graphical interface to ctmm and streamlines AKDE, its prerequisite autocorrelation modeling steps, and a number of additional movement analyses. We demonstrate ctmmweb's capabilities, including AKDE home range estimation and subsequent home range overlap analysis, on a dataset of four jaguars from the Brazilian Pantanal tracked between 2013 and 2015. We intend ctmmweb to open AKDE and related autocorrelation-explicit analyses to a wider audience of wildlife and conservation professionals. © 2021 The Authors.

		"abstract": "Animal movement has been the focus on much theoretical and empirical work in ecology over the last 25 years. By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, ﬁrst passage time, Le´vy ﬂights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.",

		"abstract": "The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.",

		"abstract": "Many animals undertake movements that are longer scaled and more directed than their typical home ranging behaviour. These movements include seasonal migrations (e.g. between breeding and feeding grounds), natal dispersal, nomadic range shifts and responses to local environmental disruptions. While various heuristic tools exist for identifying range shifts and migrations, none explicitly model the movement of the animals within a statistical framework that facilitates quantitative comparisons. We present the mechanistic range shift analysis (MRSA), a method to estimate a suite of range shift parameters: times of initiation, duration of transitions, centroids and areas of respective ranges. The method can take the autocorrelation and irregular sampling that is characteristic of much movement data into account. The mechanistic parameters suggest an intuitive measure, the range shift index, for the extent of a range shift. The likelihood based estimation further allows for statistical tests of several relevant hypotheses, including a range shift test, a stopover test and a site fidelity test. The analysis tools are provided in an R package (marcher). We applied the MRSA to a population of GPS tracked roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Italian Alps between 2005 and 2008. With respect to seasonal migration, this population is extremely variable and difficult to classify. Using the MRSA, we were able to quantify the behaviours across the population and among individuals across years, identifying extents, durations and locations of seasonal range shifts, including cases that would have been ambiguous to detect using existing tools. The strongest patterns were differences across years: many animals simply did not perform a seasonal migration to wintering grounds during the mild winter of 2006–2007, even though some of these same animals did move extensively in other, harsher winters. For seasonal migrants, however, site fidelity across years was extremely high, even after skipping an entire seasonal migration. These results suggest that for roe deer behavioural plasticity and tactical responses to immediate environmental cues are reflected in the decision of whether rather than where to migrate. The MRSA also revealed a trade-off between the probability of migrating and the size of a home range.",

We estimated the timing of emigration from natal sites using ten previously published methods. We propose and evaluate two new methods. The first of these uses published ranging distances of parents as a measure of the natal home range, with the requirement that juveniles must exceed it for a minimum of 10 days (a literature-based measure of the maximum time that a juvenile can survive without food from its parents). The second method uses the biggest difference in the proportion of locations inside and outside of the natal home range smoothed over a 30 day period to assign the point of emigration. We used the latter as the standard against which we compared the ten published methods.",

The current methods that calculate joint space use generally do not account for proximity in space use, as all of them rely on the differences between the exact spatial overlay of utilization distributions, while spatial distances between distributions should be considered to truly quantify similarity. We implemented the earth mover's distance (EMD), a spatially explicit method, that quantifies similarity between utilization distributions by calculating the effort it takes to shape one utilization distribution landscape into another, hence EMD. The EMD is a method commonly used in image retrieval applications, and we propose its use to calculate similarity in space use in the framework of movement ecology. We show that the EMD is a consistent and useful as well as versatile measure of overlap and provide an easy to use implementation in the r package move.",

Because of the high conservation value of identifying wildlife movement corridors, there has been extensive work focusing on environmental factors that contribute to the emergence of habitual routes between protected habitats. In parallel, significant work has focused on disentangling the cognitive mechanisms underlying animal route use, as such movement patterns are of fundamental interest to the study of decision making and navigation. We reviewed the types of processes that can generate routine patterns of animal movement, suggested a new methodological workflow for classifying one of these patterns—high fidelity path reuse—in animal tracking data, and compared the prevalence of this pattern across four sympatric species of frugivorous mammals in Panama. We found the highest prevalence of route-use in kinkajous, the only nocturnal species in our study, and propose that further development of this method could help to distinguish the processes underlying the presence of specific routes in animal movement data.",

		"abstract": "By viewing animal movement paths as realizations of a continuous stochastic process, we introduce a rigorous likelihood method for estimating the statistical parameters of movement processes. This method makes no assumption of a hidden Markov property, places no special emphasis on the sampling rate, is insensitive to irregular sampling and data gaps, can produce reasonable estimates with limited sample sizes and can be used to assign AIC values to a vast array of qualitatively different models of animal movement at the individual and population levels. To develop our approach, we consider the likelihood of the first two cumulants of stochastic processes, the mean and autocorrelation functions. Together, these measures provide a considerable degree of information regarding searching, foraging, migration and other aspects of animal movement. As a specific example, we develop the likelihood analyses necessary to contrast performance of animal movement models based on Brownian motion, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and a generalization of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process that includes ballistic bouts. We then show how our framework also provides a new and more accurate approach to home-range estimation when compared to estimators that neglect autocorrelation in the movement path. We apply our methods to a data set on Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) to identify the movement behaviours and their associated time and length scales that characterize the movement of each individual. Additionally, we show that gazelle annual ranges are vastly larger than those of other non-migratory ungulates.",

		"abstract": "Estimating animal home ranges and understanding the processes that influence home range behavior are important components of ecological investigations. While ecologists have been interested in the concept of home range for many decades, turning this conceptinto a usable statistical model or quantifiable metric for scientific purposes has been quite challenging. Keys to overcoming this challenge are (i) letting well-defined questions, and a solid understanding of the study system point to a specific home range metric to be quantified;(ii) choosing an appropriate estimator of this target metric;(iii) collecting location data during appropriate time periods and at the right sampling frequency; and (iv) understanding the trade-off between simplicity and complexity in modeling ecological data. If researchers follow these recommendations, many of the traditional challenges to studying animal home ranges will be alleviated due to technological advances in tracking systems and a solid foundation of models for understanding space use. However, we should continue to strive for more fundamental approaches to understanding animal movements. In particular, we see great opportunity for the continued development of agent-based models (ABM) of animal movements that allow for home range behavior to be an emergent property of the model instead of an a priori structure imposed on the data.",

		"abstract": "Space use is an important aspect of animal ecology, yet our understanding is limited by a lack of synthesis between interspecific and intraspecific studies. We present analyses of a dataset of 286 estimates of home range overlap from 100 primate species, with comparable samples for other space-use traits. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first multispecies study using overlap data estimated directly from field observations. We find that space-use traits in primates are only weakly related to body mass, reflecting their largely arboreal habits. Our results confirm a theory that home range overlap explains the differences in allometric scaling between population density and home range size. We then test a suite of hypotheses to explain home range overlap, both among and within species. We find that overlap is highest for larger-bodied species living in large home ranges at high population densities, where annual rainfall is low, and is higher for arboreal than terrestrial species. Most of these results are consistent with the economics of resource defence, although the predictions of one specific theory of home range overlap are not supported. We conclude that home range overlap is somewhat predictable, but the theoretical basis of animal space use remains patchy.",

Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements (SLDs) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal’s movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, SLD estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty.",

		"abstract": "As global change accelerates, there is a growing imperative to understand how wild animals respond to changing environments. I investigated how environmental variability, both in the short term (seasonality and habitat differences) and the long term (changing climate and habitats), shapes the behavioral ecology of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in a highly seasonal dry forest mosaic in Costa Rica. I used a multi-scale approach with the ultimate goal of gaining a more complete understanding of how individual-level selective pressures scale up over space and time to affect group and population dynamics. Perceived predation risk, based on alarm-call responses to distinct predator classes, varied among habitat types and was greatest in mature forest. The capuchins adjusted their anti-predator vigilance behavior to changing levels of perceived risk. Feeding efficiency varied over both space and time and was greatest during the wet season and in mature forest habitats, which were both associated with higher energy intake rates and lower energy expenditure rates. The hot dry season also favored smaller home ranges, with high-use zones concentrated around patches of mature evergreen forest. These findings demonstrate that environmental variability plays a key role in driving the spatial ecology of capuchin individuals and groups. Because the dry season is associated with greater energetic deficits, the capuchins' increased preference for mature forest and more compact use of space during the dry season may be a behavioral adjustment aimed at maximizing use of the most productive foraging areas and reducing travel, perhaps at the expense of safety. Finally, I examined spatial and demographic patterns in the growing capuchin population over multiple decades in relation to quantitative information on how the environment changed over the same period. The availability of evergreen habitats varied with the strength of the previous wet season, which in turn was strongly coupled with global climatic and oceanic cycles. Following extreme drought periods, population growth slowed, mean group size decreased, and reproductive rate declined. Future work will aim to develop a deeper understanding of how climate change will affect primate populations and to expand the scope and generality of this research to a global scale.",

		"abstract": "Central-place foragers can be constrained by the distance between habitats. When an organism relies on a central place for thermal refuge, the distance to food resources can potentially constrain foraging behavior. We investigated the effect of distance between thermal refuges and forage patches of the cold-intolerant marine mammal, the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), on foraging duration. We tested the alternative hypotheses of time minimization and energy maximization as a response to distance between habitats. We also determined if manatees mitigate foraging constraints with increased visits to closer thermal refuges. We used hidden Markov models to assign discrete behaviors from movement parameters as a function of water temperature and assessed the influence of distance on foraging duration in water temperatures above (> 20°C) and below (≤ 20°C) the lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone of manatees. We found that with increased distance, manatees decreased foraging duration in cold water temperature and increased foraging duration in warmer temperatures. We also found that manatees returned to closer thermal refuges more often. Our results suggest that the spatial relationship of thermal and forage habitats can impact behavioral decisions regarding foraging. Addressing foraging behavior questions while considering thermoregulatory behavior implicates the importance of understanding changing environments on animal behavior, particularly in the face of current global change.",

		"abstract": "· Home-range estimates are a common product of animal tracking data, as each range informs on the area needed by a given individual. Population-level inference on home-range areas—where multiple individual home-ranges are considered to be sampled from a population—is also important to evaluate changes over time, space, or covariates, such as habitat quality or fragmentation, and for comparative analyses of species averages. Population-level home-range parameters have traditionally been estimated by first assuming that the input tracking data were sampled independently when calculating home ranges via conventional kernel density estimation (KDE) or minimal convex polygon (MCP) methods, and then assuming that those individual home ranges were measured exactly when calculating the population-level estimates. This conventional approach does not account for the temporal autocorrelation that is inherent in modern tracking data, nor for the uncertainties of each individual home-range estimate, which are often large and heterogeneous.\n· Here, we introduce a statistically and computationally efficient framework for the population-level analysis of home-range areas, based on autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE), that can account for variable temporal autocorrelation and estimation uncertainty.\n· We apply our method to empirical examples on lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), kinkajou (Potos flavus), white‐nosed coati (Nasua narica), white-faced capuchin monkey (Cebus capucinus), and spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), and quantify differences between species, environments, and sexes.\n· Our approach allows researchers to more accurately compare different populations with different movement behaviors or sampling schedules, while retaining statistical precision and power when individual home-range uncertainties vary. Finally, we emphasize the estimation of effect sizes when comparing populations, rather than mere significance tests.",

		"abstract": "Home range behaviour is a common pattern of space use, having fundamental consequences for ecological processes. However, a general mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry - movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach - which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.",

		"abstract": "Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.",

		"abstract": "Animal space use has been studied by focusing either on geographic (e.g. home ranges, species' distribution) or on environmental (e.g. habitat use and selection) space. However, all patterns of space use emerge from individual movements, which are the primary means by which animals change their environment. Individuals increase their use of a given area by adjusting two key movement components: the duration of their visit and/or the frequency of revisits. Thus, in spatially heterogeneous environments, animals exploit known, high-quality resource areas by increasing their residence time (RT) in and/or decreasing their time to return (TtoR) to these areas. We expected that spatial variation in these two movement properties should lead to observed patterns of space use in both geographic and environmental spaces. We derived a set of nine predictions linking spatial distribution of movement properties to emerging space-use patterns. We predicted that, at a given scale, high variation in RT and TtoR among habitats leads to strong habitat selection and that long RT and short TtoR result in a small home range size. We tested these predictions using moose (Alces alces) GPS tracking data. We first modelled the relationship between landscape characteristics and movement properties. Then, we investigated how the spatial distribution of predicted movement properties (i.e. spatial autocorrelation, mean, and variance of RT and TtoR) influences home range size and hierarchical habitat selection. In landscapes with high spatial autocorrelation of RT and TtoR, a high variation in both RT and TtoR occurred in home ranges. As expected, home range location was highly selective in such landscapes (i.e. second-order habitat selection); RT was higher and TtoR lower within the selected home range than outside, and moose home ranges were small. Within home ranges, a higher variation in both RT and TtoR was associated with higher selectivity among habitat types (i.e. third-order habitat selection). Our findings show how patterns of geographic and environmental space use correspond to the two sides of a coin, linked by movement responses of individuals to environmental heterogeneity. By demonstrating the potential to assess the consequences of altering RT or TtoR (e.g. through human disturbance or climatic changes) on home range size and habitat selection, our work sets the basis for new theoretical and methodological advances in movement ecology.",

		"abstract": "Ecological theory related to animal distribution and abundance is at present incomplete and to some extent naive. We suggest that this may partly be due to a long tradition in the field of model development for choosing mathematical and statistical tools for convenience rather than applicability. Real population dynamics are influenced by nonlinear interactions, nonequilibrium conditions, and scaling complexity from system openness. Thus, a coherent theory for individual-, population-, and community-level processes should rest on mathematical and statistical methods that explicitly confront these issues in a manner that satisfies principles from statistical mechanics for complex systems. Instead, ecological theory is traditionally based on premises from simpler statistical mechanical theory for memory-free, scale-specific, random-walk, and diffusion processes, while animals from many taxa generally express strategic homing, site fidelity, and conspecific attraction in direct violation of primary model assumptions. Thus, the main challenge is to generalize the theory for memory-free physical, many-body systems to include a more realistic memory-influenced framework that better satisfies ecological realism. We describe, simulate, and discuss three testable aspects of a model for multiscaled habitat use at the individual level: (1) scale-free distribution of movement steps under influence of self-reinforcing site fidelity, (2) fractal spatial dispersion of intra-home range relocations, and (3) nonasymptotic expansion of observed intra-home range patch use with increasing set of relocations. Examples of literature data apparently supporting the conjecture that multiscaled, strategic space use is widespread among many animal taxa are also described. We suggest that the present approach, which provides a protocol to test for influence from scale-free, memory-dependent habitat use at the individual level, may also point toward a guideline for development of a generalized theoretical framework for complex population kinetics and spatiotemporal population dynamics.",

		"abstract": "Animals concentrate their activities within areas we call home ranges because information about places increases fitness. Most animals, and certainly all mammals, store information about places in cognitive maps—or neurally encoded representations of the geometric relations among places—and learn to associate objects or events with places on their map. I define the value of information as a time-dependent increment it adds to any appropriate currency of fitness for an informed versus an uninformed forager, and integrate it into simple conceptual models that help explain movements of animals that learn, forget, and use information. Unlike other space-use models, these recognize that movement decisions are based on an individual's imperfect and ever-changing expectancies about the environment—rather than omniscience or ignorance. Using simple, deterministic models, I demonstrate how the use of such dynamic information explains why animals use home ranges, and can help explain diverse movement patterns, including systematic patrolling or “traplining,” shifting activity or focal areas, extra-home-range exploration, and seemingly random (although goal-directed and spatially contagious) movements. These models also provide insights about interindividual spacing patterns, from exclusive home ranges (whether defended as territories or not) to broadly overlapping or shared ranges. Incorporating this dynamic view of animal expectancies and information value into more-complex and realistic movement models, such as random-walk, Bayesian foraging, and multi-individual movement models, should facilitate a more comprehensive and empirical understanding of animal space-use phenomena. The fitness value of cognitive maps and the selective exploitation of spatial information support a general theory of animal space use, which explains why mammals have home ranges and how they use them.",

However, trophic levels are rarely taken into consideration when estimating home range. This lapse could present issues when interpreting past studies, especially in policy-based conservation. The objectives of this study were to survey the current literature, to critically analyse published articles with home range analyses, and to compare home range size by species’ trophic level. We predicted that animals residing in higher trophic levels would have significantly larger home ranges than animals occupying lower trophic levels. We found that terrestrial carnivores had larger home ranges than terrestrial herbivores, though terrestrial mesocarnivores had the largest home ranges. We also found that aquatic herbivores had larger home ranges than both aquatic carnivores and aquatic mesocarnivores. Our results are important to consider for planning and management sectors, to avoid the implementation of ineffective conservation policies.",

There are many methods available for estimating the extent of a home range. The following, which are frequently used in primatology, are described in this entry: the grid cell approach, minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density estimators (KDE), and low convex hull (LoCoH). In recent decades, GIS technology has allowed researchers to estimate home ranges very easily. However, there is no standard method for making estimations, and when estimating and reporting home ranges, it is important to use multiple methods and to describe the data in detail to avoid misinterpretation.",

		"abstract": "The advancing role of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology in ecology has made studies of animal movement possible for larger and more vagile species. A simple field test revealed that lengths of GPS-based movement data were strongly biased (P<0.001) by effects of forest canopy. Global Positioning System error added an average of 27.5% additional length to tracks recorded under high canopy, while adding only 8.5% to open-canopy tracks, thus biasing comparisons of track length or tortuosity among habitat types. Other studies may incur different levels of bias depending on GPS sampling rates. Ninety-nine percent of track errors under high canopy were ≤7.98 m of the true path; this value can be used to set the scale-threshold at which movements are attributed to error and not biologically interpreted. This bias should be considered before interpreting GPS-based animal movement data.",

		"abstract": "Despite advances in technology, there are still constraints on the use of some tracking devices for small species when gathering high temporal and spatial resolution data on movement and resource use. For small species, weight limits imposed on GPS loggers and the consequent impacts on battery life, restrict the volume of data that can be collected. Research on home range and habitat selection for these species should therefore incorporate a consideration of how different sampling parameters and methods may affect the structure of the data and the conclusions drawn. However, factors such as these are seldom explicitly considered. We applied two commonly-used methods of home range estimation, Movement-based Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to investigate the influence of fix rate, tracking duration and method on home range size and habitat selection, using GPS tracking data collected at two different fix rates from a small, aerially-insectivorous bird, the European nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus. Effects of tracking parameters varied with home range estimation method. Fix rate and tracking duration most strongly explained change in MKDE and KDE home range size respectively. Total number of fixes and tracking duration had the strongest impact on habitat selection. High between- and within-individual variation strongly influenced outcomes and was most evident when exploring the effects of varying tracking duration. To reduce skew and bias in home range size estimation and especially habitat selection caused by individual variation and estimation method, we recommend tracking animals for the longest period possible even if this results in a reduced fix rate. If accurate movement properties, (e.g. trajectory length and turning angle) and biologically-representative movement occurrence ranges are more important, then a higher fix rate should be used, but priority habitats can still be identified with an infrequent sampling strategy.",

		"abstract": "Summary 1. Compared to traditional radio-collars, global positioning system (GPS) collars provide finer spatial resolution and collect locations across a broader range of spatial and temporal conditions. However, data from GPS collars are biased because vegetation and terrain interfere with the satellite signals necessary to acquire a location. Analyses of habitat selection generally proceed without correcting for this known sampling bias. We documented the effects of bias in resource selection functions (RSF) and compared the effectiveness of two bias-correction techniques. 2. The effects of environmental conditions on the probability of a GPS collar collecting a location were modelled for three brands of collar using data collected in 24-h trials at 194 test locations. The best-supported model was used to create GPS-biased data from unbiased animal locations. These data were used to assess the effects of bias given data losses in the range of 10-40% at both 1- and 6-h sampling intensities. We compared the sign, value and significance of coefficients derived using biased and unbiased data. 3. With 6-h locations we observed type II error rates of 30-40% given as little as a 10% data loss. Biased data also produced coefficients that were significantly more negative than unbiased estimates. Increasing the sampling intensity from 6- to 1-h locations eliminated type II errors but increased the magnitude of coefficient bias. No type I errors or changes in sign were observed. 4. We applied sample weighting and iterative simulation given a 30% data loss. For a biased vegetation type, simulation reduced more type II errors than weighting, most probably because the original sample size was re-established. However, selection for areas near trails, which was influenced by a biased vegetation type, showed fewer type II errors after weighting existing animal locations than after simulation. Both techniques corrected 100% and ≥ 80% of the biased coefficients at the 6- and 1-h sampling intensities, respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that GPS error is predictable and biases the coefficients of resource selection models dependant upon the GPS sam- pling intensity and the level of data loss. We provide effective alternatives for correcting bias and discuss applying corrections under different sampling designs.",

		"abstract": "This paper considers the problem of estimating the home-range size of an animal from locational data, which are usually collected by use of radio telemetry, with convex hull-based estimators. It is shown that the widely used minimum convex polygon has some undesirable characteristics as an estimator, and thus should be used with caution. A method based on convex hull peeling of the data to estimate convex density contours is studied as an alternative simple home-range size estimator. Monte Carlo simulations show that this estimator has very similar statistical properties if the point fixes are generated from a bivariate normal distribution, a uniform on a disc distribution, and two other distributions with intermediate tail behaviour. These standard distributions are used as a reference to define a sample size bias-corrected estimator of home-range size, and to provide an approximate method for calculating the precision of this estimator. The technique is applied to the estimation of the home-range sizes of deer.",

		"abstract": "1 Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2 We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3 To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4 Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50%. 5 Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6 The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7 We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.",

This chapter describes a variety of techniques used to analyze animal space use, including home range estimation, analysis of site fidelity, and animal interactions. It also provides limitations of using many traditional techniques. The chapter provides a discussion of modeling animal movements using a combination of advanced descriptive and visualization approaches, general movement models, and biological models. The importance of sample size and autocorrelation of data in estimating home ranges and animal movements cannot be overemphasized. When considering tradeoffs between sample size and independence, obtaining an adequate sample size is more important than independence between data points. Any analysis of radiotelemetry data must consider the full range of biological and environmental factors that may impact the results. Home range estimation and animal movement analyses must answer difficult questions regarding the internal anatomy of home range boundaries and movement pathways through the judicious use of biological and environmental information. Also, radiotelemetry studies should go beyond simple, general descriptions and use a model-driven approach to examine the key factors determining why and how an animal uses space.",

We used areaunder-the-curve to explore the fit of 8 estimators of home range to data collected with both GPS and concurrent very high frequency (VHF) technology on a terrestrial mammal, the Florida panther Puma concolor coryi, to evaluate recently developed and traditional estimators.\nResults: Area-under-the-curve was the highest for Florida panthers equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology compared to VHF technology. For our study animal, estimators of home range that incorporated a temporal component to estimation performed better than traditional first- and second-generation estimators.\nConclusions: Comparisons of fit of home range contours with locations collected would suggest that use of VHF technology is not as accurate as GPS technology to estimate size of home range for large mammals. Estimators of home range collected with GPS technology performed better than those estimated with VHF technology regardless of estimator used. Furthermore, estimators that incorporate a temporal component (third-generation estimators) appeared to be the most reliable regardless of whether kernel-based or Brownian bridge-based algorithms were used and in comparison to first- and second-generation estimators. We defined third-generation estimators of home range as any estimator that incorporates time, space, animal-specific parameters, and habitat. Such estimators would include movement-based kernel density, Brownian bridge movement models, and dynamic Brownian bridge movement models among others that have yet to be evaluated.",

Although multiple studies can be meta-analyzed in such a way that scientific hypotheses can be tested, robust meta-analyses are often difficult or impossible if variables of interest are not measured in a uniform manner. We hypothesized that measurements, even of basic and unequivocal variables, are rarely standardized in wildlife sciences. We tested this assumption by reviewing randomly selected papers that describe the home range of mammals (n = 25) and birds (n = 25). In these papers, home ranges were calculated using 11 methods and 8 computer programs. The number of radiolocations used to calculate home ranges varied from 9 to >2,000. By estimating home ranges for two radiotelemetry data sets, we demonstrate that home ranges are not comparable if different methods are used and that estimates of home range are not standardized. We assume that measurements of other biological variables are even less consistent across studies.

		"abstract": "Abstract Understanding animal movement is a key challenge in ecology and conservation biology. Relocation data often represent a complex mixture of different movement behaviors, and reliably decomposing this mix into its component parts is an unresolved problem in movement ecology. Traditional approaches, such as composite random walk models, require that the timescales characterizing the movement are all similar to the usually arbitrary data-sampling rate. Movement behaviors such as long-distance searching and fine-scale foraging, however, are often intermixed but operate on vastly different spatial and temporal scales. An approach that integrates the full sweep of movement behaviors across scales is currently lacking. Here we show how the semivariance function (SVF) of a stochastic movement process can both identify multiple movement modes and solve the sampling rate problem. We express a broad range of continuous-space, continuous-time stochastic movement models in terms of their SVFs, connect them to relocation data via variogram regression, and compare them using standard model selection techniques. We illustrate our approach using Mongolian gazelle relocation data and show that gazelle movement is characterized by ballistic foraging movements on a 6-h timescale, fast diffusive searching with a 10-week timescale, and asymptotic diffusion over longer timescales.",

		"abstract": "Home-range estimation is an important application of animal tracking data that is frequently complicated by autocorrelation, sampling irregularity, and small effective sample sizes. We introduce a novel, optimal weighting method that accounts for temporal sampling bias in autocorrelated tracking data. This method corrects for irregular and missing data, such that oversampled times are downweighted and undersampled times are upweighted to minimize error in the home-range estimate. We also introduce computationally efficient algorithms that make this method feasible with large data sets. Generally speaking, there are three situations where weight optimization improves the accuracy of home-range estimates: with marine data, where the sampling schedule is highly irregular, with duty cycled data, where the sampling schedule changes during the observation period, and when a small number of home-range crossings are observed, making the beginning and end times more independent and informative than the intermediate times. Using both simulated data and empirical examples including reef manta ray, Mongolian gazelle, and African buffalo, optimal weighting is shown to reduce the error and increase the spatial resolution of home-range estimates. With a conveniently packaged and computationally efficient software implementation, this method broadens the array of data sets with which accurate space-use assessments can be made.",

For cases in which the null hypothesis of independence is rejected, a procedure for determining the time interval at which autocorrelation becomes negligible is presented. To illustrate implementation of the test, locational data obtained from a radio-tagged adult female cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus were used. -from Authors",

By definition, the concept of a home range involves autocorrelated movements, but estimates or hypothesis tests based on sampling designs that predefine a time frame of interest, and that generate representative samples of an animal's movement during this time frame, should not be affected by length of the sampling interval and autocorrelation. Intensive sampling of the individual's home range and habitat use during the time frame of the study leads to improved estimates for the individual, but use of location estimates as the sample unit to compare across animals is pseudoreplication. We therefore recommend against use of habitat selection analysis techniques that use locations instead of individuals as the sample unit.

Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals. We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data. The area-corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives. This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home-range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the ctmm r package.",

		"abstract": "More than 114 species of mammals originally were present in Costa Rica’s tropical dry forest, and perhaps 110 species are still found there today. Bats are the most diverse group, with more than 66 species, followed by 11 species of rodents, 7 species of marsupials, 6 species in the weasel family, 5 species of cats, 3 species in the raccoon family, 3 species of primates, 3 species of artiodactyls, 2 species of canids, 2 species of xenarthrans (edentates), 1 rabbit, and 1 tapir. Costa Rica has no endemic dry forest mammals. The species that have been extirpated from this region were either highly prized game species that have been eliminated by overhunting (white-lipped peccaries) or were specialists that either feed on specific foods or have very specific habitat requirements that have been eliminated by habitat destruction. In Costa Rica 10 of the 13 mammal species recognized as endangered and 7 of the 14 found in reduced populations are found within tropical dry forest habitat. Mammals that inhabit tropical dry forest areas must be capable of dealing with high temperatures, low precipitation in the dry season, and large fluctuations in the availability of food resources during the year. Most mammals of the dry forest can be characterized as resident generalists that shift their diets in order to utilize seasonally available food resources; as resident specialists that forage on insects, seeds, or fruit and nectar; or as migrants that occupy dry forests only seasonally and move to other habitats during periods of low food availability in their foraging area in search of food sources in other areas. Bats, some of which serve as pollinators and seed dispersers, are important components of the dry forest fauna. Some species of bats change habitats within the dry forest or migrate into and out of the dry forest seasonally. Hunting has been, and continues to be, an important threat to most large mammals in dry forest habitats. As early as 1880, large numbers of deer skins were exported from Costa Rica to Europe, the majority of which came from Guanacaste. Illegal poaching is still a serious problem in the protected areas of Guanacaste. Throughout Mesoamerica, deforestation to create pastures and, in recent years, for crop cultivation has negatively affected many populations of tropical dry forest mammals. Approximately 50% of the 250,000 ha area in the lower Tempisque Basin had been deforested by 1956 and by 1970 most of the dry forest had been converted into pastureland. The spread of introduced African grasses and seasonal fires have continued to eliminate mature dry forest in northern Costa Rica in the last decades. Contamination by pesticides from agricultural fields has become a serious threat to the mammalian fauna in the region. The use of cattle as a management tool also threatens the mammalian fauna in tropical dry forest due to their affect on the natural vegetation. Cattle were reintroduced into Parque Nacional Palo Verde in the 1980s in an attempt to control the rapidly expanding cattails in the marsh, which were eliminating habitat for aquatic birds. However, cattle have been ineffective at controlling cattails, and overgrazing of tree seedlings has hindered regeneration of the forest because cattle graze selectively on seedlings of native species. The mammals of the tropical dry forest are among the most poorly known of any of the bioclimatic life zones. Conservation measures for this endangered fauna should include expanded research, training and educational programs for park personnel, economic alternatives, and sustainable development. In addition, efforts should be made for the creation of additional protected areas with buffer zones and for the development of natural regeneration programs. Resumen--Originalmente existían más de 114 especies de mamíferos en el bosque tropical seco de Costa Rica, pero quizá este número ha disminuído a 110 especies. Los murciélagos son el grupo más diverso con más de 66 especies, seguido por los rodeadores con 11 especies, 7 especies de marsupiales, 6 especies en la familia de las comadrejas, 5 especies de gatos silvestres, 3 especies en la familia de los mapachines, 3 especies de primates, 3 especies de artiodáctilos, 2 especies de caninos, 2 especies de edentados, 1 conejo y 1 tapir. En el bosque seco de Costa Rica no se encuentran mamíferos endémicos. Las especies de mamíferos que han desaparecido de esta región han sido especies muy cotizadas por los cazadores o especialistas de hábitats específicos que desaparecieron como resultado de la deforestación. En Costa Rica, 10 de las 13 especies de mamíferos reconocidos en peligro de extinción y 7 de las 14 que se encuentran en poblaciones reducidas se encuentran en el hábitat de bosque seco. Los mamíferos que viven en el bosque tropical seco deben ser capaces aguantar temperaturas altas, poca precipitación durante la sequía, asi como sobrevivir a grandes fluctuaciones en la disponibilidad alimentos a través del año. La mayoría de mamíferos del bosque seco se pueden clasificar como generalistas residentes que cambian sus dietas para utilizar los recursos disponibles estacionalmente; especialistas residentes que forrajean insectos, semillas, frutas o néctar; o como migratorios que habitan el bosque seco estacionalmente y se desplazan a otros hábitats durante épocas escazes de recursos alimentarios. Los murciélagos son componentes importantes de la fauna del bosque seco por su papel en la dispersión de semillas y polinización de plantas. Algunas especies de murciélagos cambian de hábitat en el bosque seco o migran estacionalmente hacía otras zonas fuera del bosque seco. La cacería ha sido y continúa siendo una amenaza importante para la mayoría de los mamíferos grandes del bosque seco. A partir de 1880 se exportaron muchas pieles de venado de Costa Rica hacía Europa y la mayoría de estas vinieron de Guanacaste. La cacería ilegal todavía es un problema grave en áreas protegidas en Guanacaste. A través de Mesoamerica la deforestación para crear pastos y en años recientes para la agricultura ha afectado negativamente muchas poblaciones de mamíferos del bosque seco. Aproximadamente 50% del área de 250,000 ha de la región de la cuenca bajo del río Tempisque fue deforestada antes de 1956 y para 1970 la mayor parte del bosque seco ya había sido convertida a pastos. En las últimas décadas, el incremento de los pastos africanos y fuegos estacionales ha continuado la destrucción del bosque seco tropical en el norte de Costa Rica. La contaminación por pesticidas en los campos agrícolas se ha convertido en una seria amenaza para los mamíferos de la región. El uso de ganado como herramienta de manejo también es una amenaza para la fauna de mamíferos en el bosque tropical seco debido a su efecto en la vegetación natural. Un ejemplo de esto es la reintroducción de ganado en el Parque Nacional Palo Verde en 1980 con el fin de controlar Typha en la laguna, las cuales estaban eliminando hábitat para las aves acuáticas. Sin embargo, no se han tenido éxito utilizando el ganado para controlar la Typha y el pastoreo ha interferido en la regeneración del bosque debido a que el ganado consume varias especies de plántulas nativas. Los mamíferos del bosque tropical seco forman parte de los organismos menos conocidos de todas las zonas bioclimáticas. Se deben desarrollar programas especiales para la conservación para proteger esta fauna en peligro que incluyan mayor investigación científica básica, programas de entrenamiento y educación para el personal de los parques, alternativas económicas y desarrollo sostenible. Además se debe hacer un esfuerzo para crear más áreas protegidas con zonas de amortiguamiento, así como programas de regeneración natural del bosque.",

		"abstract": "A new classification and conceptual framework for plant phenology are proposed to resolve problems in describing tropical patterns. A long-term (12 yr) survey of flowering in 254 lowland tropical rain forest trees of 173 species from the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica showed highly diverse, irregular, and complex patterns. Analysis of this survey data relied primarily on graphical analyses that provide data representation methods rather than numerical summaries that provide data reduction methods. The classification differs from previous ones in three ways. It uses, as the primary criterion, frequency of the time series, based on explicit time and amplitude scales, so that irregular temporal sequences are revealed. It features a system of subsidiary classes based on other quantitative descriptors: regularity, duration, amplitude, date, and synchrony Finally, the conceptual framework separates patterns at each level of analysis so that adding the time series at one level produces a time series for the next higher level. Levels are hierarchical from the flower to the individual, population, and community with additional non-nested levels such as the guild. The four basic classes-continual, subannual, annual, and supra-annual-are applied to patterns at any level of analysis. The classification system provides a logical framework for quantitative description of phenological behavior leading to more standardized comparisons. Thus we can see that tropical phenology differs from temperate phenology in two major ways. In tropical species, the nature of the pattern may change from one level of analysis to the next, which is not typical of temperate species. In many tropical species, phenological patterns vary more widely over the geographic range of a species than they do in temperate species.",

This book, based on more than thirty years of study, offers the first comprehensive look at the ecology, biodiversity, and conservation status of this endangered and fragile region. The contributors, from Costa Rica, Britain, Mexico, and the United States, and representing the fields of ecology, environmental education, policy, and the law, examine the major plant and animal groups living in the dry forest and present the first technical evaluation of Costa Rica's conservation efforts. As they assess the status of their area of specialty in the dry forest, the contributors also look beyond this particular region to show how its plants and animals are ecologically and evolutionarily connected to other geographic areas in Costa Rica and Central America. Their chapters cover topics such as watershed and coastal management, plant phenology, pollination, insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. They also consider the socioeconomic, policy, legal, and political aspects of biodiversity conservation, giving the volume a wide-ranging perspective and making a unique contribution to our knowledge of the tropical dry forest. The book concludes with an important synthesis of the contributors' recommendations on future directions, policies, and actions that will better conserve biodiversity in Costa Rica and other neotropical forests as well.",

		"abstract": "A study of nest site and habitat preferences of five tree-hole nesting bee species of the genus Centris (family Anthophoridae) was conducted in 1986 at the Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve in the Costa Rican dry forest. Centris bees, which are important pollinators of a large proportion of the dry forest flora, were lured to artificial traps in a habitat monitoring study and an experimental preference study, which tested for exposure to sun, nest hole diameter, and height above ground level. The habitat monitoring study demonstrated that C. bicornuta, C. vittata, and possibly C. trigonoides had an overall preference for the more shaded riparian and/or mesic forests. Centris bicornuta also showed some preference for oak forests, whereas C. nitida had a clear preference for this habitat. Centris analis had no obvious preference for particular habitats. The experimental study demonstrated that three Centris species had a strong preference for shaded sites and an 8 mm nest hole diameter; no preference was indicated for height above ground level. A preliminary study of temperature relationships suggested that temperatures around 40$^\\circ$C were lethal to early instar bee larvae. The temperature studies also suggested that shaded habitats had more optimal temperatures for Centris development. Overall results of this investigation were considered within the framework of available habitat area. It was estimated that the preferred shaded habitats, riparian and mesic forests, accounted for only $\\sim$13 percent of the total land area at Lomas Barbudal. The nonpreferred habitats, such as the dry deciduous, extreme dry, savanna and regenerative forest habitats accounted for $\\sim$86 percent of the Reserve area. Thus, it appears that a relatively low percentage of the land is supporting most of the nesting habitat(s) for this specialized group of Centris bees.",

Some accounts of phenological events in the tropical literature occur only as brief notes which form small sections of larger papers (e.g., Ducke and Black, 1953; Beard, 1946). Other information on specific phenological events can be found in floristic treatments (e.g., Allen, 1956; Little and Wadsworth, 1964) and papers dealing with species of economic importance (e.g., Broekmans, 1957; Lamb, 1966, Rees, 1964). In certain studies the data on periodicity of a small percentage of species have been pooled in an attempt to reflect the general phenological trends of particular vegetation types (e.g., Bakerand Baker, 1936; Daubenmire, 1972).",

Five behavior patterns qualified as social traditions, according to the studys criteria: handsniffing, sucking of body parts, and three types of games. Some conventions were independently invented in virtually identical form at multiple sites. The extinction of several conventions was observed during the course of the study; it appears that they rarely last longer than ten years. It is hypothesized that the monkeys are using these group or cliquespecific social conventions to test the quality of their social relationships.",

		"abstract": "The parallel evolution of increased sensorimotor intelligence in humans and capuchins has been linked to the cognitive and manual demands of seasonal extractive faunivory. This hypothesis is attractive on theoretical grounds, but it has eluded widespread acceptance due to lack of empirical data. For instance, the effects of seasonality on the extractive foraging behaviors of capuchins are largely unknown. Here we report foraging observations on four groups of wild capuchins (Cebus capucinus) inhabiting a seasonally dry tropical forest. We also measured intra-annual variation in temperature, rainfall, and food abundance. We found that the exploitation of embedded or mechanically protected invertebrates was concentrated during periods of fruit scarcity. Such a pattern suggests that embedded insects are best characterized as a fallback food for capuchins. We discuss the implications of seasonal extractive faunivory for the evolution of sensorimotor intelligence (SMI) in capuchins and hominins and suggest that the suite of features associated with SMI, including increased manual dexterity, tool use, and innovative problem solving are cognitive adaptations among frugivores that fall back seasonally on extractable foods. The selective pressures acting on SMI are predicted to be strongest among primates living in the most seasonal environments. This model is proffered to explain the differences in tool use between capuchin lineages, and SMI as an adaptation to extractive foraging is suggested to play an important role in hominin evolution.",

		"abstract": "The limiting factor for fitness in female primates is the acquisition of high-quality food, i.e., food that is high in energy and nutrients, such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Reproductive status can influence female feeding patterns, e.g., lactating females in some primate species consume greater quantities of food and specific nutrients than do nonlactating females. We examined the energy intake, ingestion rate, and composition of the diet in female white-faced capuchins in 3 reproductive states: lactating, gestating, and cycling. We observed 12 reproductively active females for 7 mo and compared their energy intake, ingestion rates, and intake rates of nutrients: protein, fat, sugar, and fiber. Lactating females took in significantly more energy per hour while feeding than pregnant and cycling females did. Lactating females also ingested significantly more food items per hour, but they did not spend more time eating than other females did, and they did not differ in the composition of their diet as measured by insect consumption and proportion of protein. Pregnant and cycling females did not differ from each other in any of the measures. We predicted that as the infants aged and began to move independently to forage and play, their mothers’ energy intake rates would decrease in concert with decreased energy demands by the infant. We found a statistically significant relationship between these 2 factors, with infant age explaining 75.4% of variation in mothers’ energy intake, supporting previous studies that found lactation to be the most energetically expensive reproductive state.",

		"abstract": "During 12 years of observation, we have observed three confirmed and two inferred lethal coalitionary attacks on adult male white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) by members of two habituated social groups at Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica. In one case, an alpha male was badly wounded and evicted from his group, and when later found by his former groupmates he was attacked by several of them and died less than 24 h later. In two other cases, lone extra-group males were mobbed by adult and immature males of a bisexual group. The fourth and fifth cases resulted from intergroup encounters. The observed death rate from coalitionary aggression at our site is approximately the same as that reported for eastern chimpanzees. Because at least three of the five observed incidents involved large coalitions attacking lone victims, they support the general hypothesis that imbalances of power contribute to intraspecific killing in primates. However, the occurrence of lethal coalitional attacks in a species lacking fission-fusion social organization poses a challenge to the more specific version of the imbalance-of-power hypothesis proposed by Manson and Wrangham in 1991 to explain chimpanzee and human intergroup aggression.

A simple example shows they are not directly comparable. Furthermore, when home ranges lack circular symmetry, methods based on capture radii suffer large biases. On the other hand, methods based on polygons have sample size biases. A new method, based on the determinant of the covariance matrix of the capture points, is introduced. We show that this method, under specified assumptions, is free from both forms of bias. Tables that identify the biases in the polygon methods are provided. An important use of the tables, that of making comparisons between values obtained by the various methods of estimation, is illustrated. The statistical stability of each method is given by means of a table or formula for its relative variance as a function of sample size. Finally, the methods are evaluated. For purposes of estimating home range area, the determinant method is recommended, the old convex polygon method is defended, and the use of methods based on capture radii is discouraged.",

		"abstract": "Over the past 20 years, GPS collars have emerged as powerful tools for the study of nonhuman primate (hereafter, “primate”) movement ecology. As the size and cost of GPS collars have decreased and performance has improved, it is timely to review the use and success of GPS collar deployments on primates to date. Here we compile data on deployments and performance of GPS collars by brand and examine how these relate to characteristics of the primate species and field contexts in which they were deployed. The compiled results of 179 GPS collar deployments across 17 species by 16 research teams show these technologies can provide advantages, particularly in adding to the quality, quantity, and temporal span of data collection. However, aspects of this technology still require substantial improvement in order to make deployment on many primate species pragmatic economically. In particular, current limitations regarding battery lifespan relative to collar weight, the efficacy of remote drop-off mechanisms, and the ability to remotely retrieve data need to be addressed before the technology is likely to be widely adopted. Moreover, despite the increasing utility of GPS collars in the field, they remain substantially more expensive than VHF collars and tracking via handheld GPS units, and cost considerations of GPS collars may limit sample sizes and thereby the strength of inferences. Still, the overall high quality and quantity of data obtained, combined with the reduced need for on-the-ground tracking by field personnel, may help defray the high equipment cost. We argue that primatologists armed with the information in this review have much to gain from the recent, substantial improvements in GPS collar technology.",

We investigated whether immediate or delayed reproductive opportunities predicted dispersal decisions and reproductive success of subordinate immigrant male white-faced capuchins in the Sector Santa Rosa, the Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We collected genetic, behavioral, and demographic data from four social groups across 20 years. We genotyped individuals at up to 20 short tandem repeat loci to determine paternity. Having previously sired offspring in a group did not predict the subordinate immigrant male’s likelihood of staying or dispersing. Instead, a male was more likely to remain in the group if he was younger and likely to benefit from queuing for future reproductive opportunities. Subordinate immigrant males were more likely to sire offspring if they resided with a long-term alpha male and his mature daughters, who avoid inbreeding. Reproductive output was similar among three categories of males: those that became alpha immediately after immigration, those that became alpha after queuing, and subordinate males that resided with a long-term alpha male and his mature daughters. These three categories of males had higher reproductive success than subordinates who did not reside with mature daughters of the alpha male. Waiting for reproductive opportunities can lead to high reproductive success and could be important in maintaining tolerant or cooperative male-male relationships in species with high reproductive skew, long alpha male tenures, and intense between-group mating competition requiring cooperative male group defense.",

While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.",

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.",

		"abstract": "Technological advances have steadily increased the detail of animal tracking datasets, yet fundamental data limitations exist for many species that cause substantial biases in home-range estimation. Specifically, the effective sample size of a range estimate is proportional to the number of observed range crossings, not the number of sampled locations. Currently, the most accurate home-range estimators condition on an autocorrelation model, for which the standard estimation frame-works are based on likelihood functions, even though these methods are known to underestimate variance—and therefore ranging area—when effective sample sizes are small. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) is a widely used method for reducing bias in maximum-likelihood (ML) variance estimation at small sample sizes. Unfortunately, we find that REML is too unstable for practical application to continuous-time movement models. When the effective sample size N is decreased to N ≤ (10), which is common in tracking applications, REML undergoes a sudden divergence in variance estimation. To avoid this issue, while retaining REML’s first-order bias correction, we derive a family of estimators that leverage REML to make a perturbative correction to ML. We also derive AIC values for REML and our estimators, including cases where model structures differ, which is not generally understood to be possible. Using both simulated data and GPS data from lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), we show how our perturbative estimators are more accurate than traditional ML and REML methods. Specifically, when (5) home-range crossings are observed, REML is unreliable by orders of magnitude, ML home ranges are 30% underestimated, and our perturbative estimators yield home ranges that are only 10% underestimated. A parametric bootstrap can then reduce the ML and perturbative home-range underestimation to 10% and 3%, respectively. Home-range estimation is one of the primary reasons for collecting animal tracking data, and small effective sample sizes are a more common problem than is currently realized. The methods introduced here allow for more accurate movement-model and home-range estimation at small effective sample sizes, and thus fill an important role for animal movement analysis. Given REML’s widespread use, our methods may also be useful in other contexts where effective sample sizes are small.",

However, linking individual behavior during group decision-making to the preferences underlying those actions poses a considerable challenge. Optimal foraging theory, and specifically the marginal value theorem (MVT), can provide predictions about individual preferences, against which the behavior of groups can be compared under different models of influence. A major strength of formally linking optimal foraging theory to collective behavior is that it generates predictions that can easily be tested under field conditions. This opens the door to studying group decision-making in a range of species; a necessary step for revealing the ecological drivers and evolutionary consequences of collective decision-making.",

		"abstract": "Over the past 20 years, GPS collars have emerged as powerful tools for the study of nonhuman primate (hereafter, “primate”) movement ecology. As the size and cost of GPS collars have decreased and performance has improved, it is timely to review the use and success of GPS collar deployments on primates to date. Here we compile data on deployments and performance of GPS collars by brand and examine how these relate to characteristics of the primate species and field contexts in which they were deployed. The compiled results of 179 GPS collar deployments across 17 species by 16 research teams show these technologies can provide advantages, particularly in adding to the quality, quantity, and temporal span of data collection. However, aspects of this technology still require substantial improvement in order to make deployment on many primate species pragmatic economically. In particular, current limitations regarding battery lifespan relative to collar weight, the efficacy of remote drop-off mechanisms, and the ability to remotely retrieve data need to be addressed before the technology is likely to be widely adopted. Moreover, despite the increasing utility of GPS collars in the field, they remain substantially more expensive than VHF collars and tracking via handheld GPS units, and cost considerations of GPS collars may limit sample sizes and thereby the strength of inferences. Still, the overall high quality and quantity of data obtained, combined with the reduced need for on-the-ground tracking by field personnel, may help defray the high equipment cost. We argue that primatologists armed with the information in this review have much to gain from the recent, substantial improvements in GPS collar technology.",

		"abstract": "Primatologists use data collected by GPS devices to answer a wide variety of scientific questions. GPS data on locations where individuals were recorded as present or absent can provide insight into primate genetic diversity, dispersal patterns, densities, and habitat suitability (e.g., Guschanski et al. 2009; Hickey et al. 2012; Junker et al. 2012; Kouakou et al. 2009). GPS data on locations of primates’ daily travel paths provide an even wider range of information. Knowing how locations change over time can inform us on disease transmission probabilities, the impact of seasonality in food availability, or differences in social organization (e.g., Lehmann &amp; Boesch 2005; Olupot et al. 1997; Walsh et al. 2005). Calculations of travel distances reveal indices of energy expenditure (e.g., Steudel 2000), while calculations of travel speed provide information on vigilance behavior, levels of food competition, and anticipation of food finding (e.g., Janmaat et al. 2006; Noser &amp; Byrne 2009; Pochron 2001). In addition, travel shape (e.g., linearity of or directional changes in the travel path) can help us reveal cognitive abilities, such as spatio-temporal memory or planning skills (Milton 2000; Noser &amp; Byrne 2007; Valero &amp; Byrne 2007). Lastly, knowledge about directional changes improves our understanding of the importance of specific locations in the habitat, such as fruit trees (Asensio et al. 2011; Byrne et al. 2009). Within this large number of studies, very few reported that GPS devices make errors that can affect the scientific conclusions that are drawn. Even fewer studies investigated how we can limit or correct these errors. In this chapter, we therefore discuss the issues we encountered when using a handheld commercial GPS device (Garmin GPSMAP® 60CSx) to estimate travel locations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in a West African rain forest. We present methods we used for testing the accuracy of the GPS device and provide primatologists with ideas on how to clean and smooth track data.",

		"abstract": "Gibbons are highly territorial and have two key areas within these territories. The core area in which we find all sleeping trees and the trees from which the gibbons duet and the wider home range (HR) which has varying levels of overlap with neighbouring gibbon groups. The core area is strenously defended, with the wider HR being more of a shared area for neighbouring groups. We present ranging and movement data on four wild gibbon groups from January 2010 to July 2018. Global Positioning System (GPS) data were collected every 5 mins on habitauted groups in Sebangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia resulting in 35,521 waypoints. Gibbon home- and corerange sizes were calculated using 95%, and 50%, volume contours of kernel density estimates. Home-ranges ranged from 58.74–147.75 ha with a mean of 95.7 ± SD 37.75 ha, the highest of comparable Hylobates species. Core-range size ranged from 20.7–51.31 ha with a mean size of 31.7 ± SD 13.76 ha. Gibbons had consistant site fidelity for their home- and core ranges; percentage overlap ranged from 4.3 23.97% with a mean 16.5 ± SD 8.65% overlap in home-range area. Core ranges did not overlap with the exception of two groups, in which a 0.64 ha (2.69%) overlap occurred. Unsurprisingly forest loss from fire does affect the location of the HR of the impacted group, but does not appear to affect adjacent groups, though more data are needed on this. Understanding the complex use of space of these territorial animals is important in assessing both carrying capacity for wild populations and understading how reintroduced gibbon pairs will establish their core and HR.",

Using location data from 1998 to 2017, we investigated within- and between-group competition in 12 groups of wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). As within-group feeding competition is expected to increase with group size, an increase in group size is predicted to lead to an increase in the size of annual home ranges and core areas, but to a decrease in fidelity (reuse of an area). Due to asymmetries in competitive abilities, larger groups are expected to have higher exclusivity (degree of non-shared space) of annual home ranges and core areas than smaller groups.\nResults:  We found evidence of within-group feeding competition based on a positive relationship between group size and both annual home range and core area size as well as a negative relationship between group size and core area fidelity. Additionally, fidelity of core areas was lower than of home ranges. Between-group competition was inferred from a trend for groups with more members and more males to have more exclusive home ranges and core areas. Lastly, annual core areas were largely mutually exclusive.\nConclusions:  Our study suggests that non-territorial, group-living animals can have highly dynamic, long-term avoidance-based spacing patterns, both temporally and spatially, to maintain annual core area exclusivity among groups while concurrently shifting these areas annually within overlapping home ranges to avoid resource depletion. Despite ranging in larger home ranges and core areas, larger groups were able to maintain more exclusive ranges than smaller groups, suggesting a competitive advantage for larger groups in between-group competition in a nonterritorial species.

		"abstract": "Space use is an important aspect of animal ecology, yet our understanding is limited by a lack of synthesis between interspecific and intraspecific studies. We present analyses of a dataset of 286 estimates of home range overlap from 100 primate species, with comparable samples for other space-use traits. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first multispecies study using overlap data estimated directly from field observations. We find that space-use traits in primates are only weakly related to body mass, reflecting their largely arboreal habits. Our results confirm a theory that home range overlap explains the differences in allometric scaling between population density and home range size. We then test a suite of hypotheses to explain home range overlap, both among and within species. We find that overlap is highest for larger-bodied species living in large home ranges at high population densities, where annual rainfall is low, and is higher for arboreal than terrestrial species. Most of these results are consistent with the economics of resource defence, although the predictions of one specific theory of home range overlap are not supported. We conclude that home range overlap is somewhat predictable, but the theoretical basis of animal space use remains patchy.",

		"abstract": "We test the hypothesis that cross-species variation in home range size across primates is determined by the metabolic needs of the animals occupying the home range and by their diet. Metabolic needs are calculated from published records of group structure, time spent in different activities and the metabolic costs of those activities. Data from 20 species demonstrate clear relationships between home range, diet and metabolic needs. Although correlations are in the expected directions, simple models relating diet to home range size and metabolic needs do not predict the functional relationships found. This may be because the data are inadequate or because the models are wrong. An empirical relationship between relative home-range size and diet distinguishes between the arboreal and terrestrial species in the sample.",

		"abstract": "GPS-based tracking is widely used for studying wild social animals. Much like traditional observational methods, using GPS devices requires making a number of decisions about sampling that can affect the robustness of a study's conclusions. For example, sampling fewer individuals per group across more distinct social groups may not be sufficient to infer group- or subgroup-level behaviours, while sampling more individuals per group across fewer groups limits the ability to draw conclusions about populations. Here, we provide quantitative recommendations when designing GPS-based tracking studies of animal societies. We focus on the trade-offs between three fundamental axes of sampling effort: (1) sampling coverage—the number and allocation of GPS devices among individuals in one or more social groups; (2) sampling duration—the total amount of time over which devices collect data and (3) sampling frequency—the temporal resolution at which GPS devices record data. We first test GPS tags under field conditions to quantify how these aspects of sampling design can affect both GPS accuracy (error in absolute positional estimates) and GPS precision (error in the estimate relative position of two individuals), demonstrating that GPS error can have profound effects when inferring distances between individuals. We then use data from whole-group tracked vulturine guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum to demonstrate how the trade-off between sampling frequency and sampling duration can impact inferences of social interactions and to quantify how sampling coverage can affect common measures of social behaviour in animal groups, identifying which types of measures are more or less robust to lower coverage of individuals. Finally, we use data-informed simulations to extend insights across groups of different sizes and cohesiveness. Based on our results, we are able to offer a range of recommendations on GPS sampling strategies to address research questions across social organizational scales and social systems—from group movement to social network structure and collective decision-making. Our study provides practical advice for empiricists to navigate their decision-making processes when designing GPS-based field studies of animal social behaviours, and highlights the importance of identifying the optimal deployment decisions for drawing informative and robust conclusions.",

		"abstract": "Accurately quantifying species’ area requirements is a prerequisite for effective area-based conservation. This typically involves collecting tracking data on species of interest and then conducting home-range analyses. Problematically, autocorrelation in tracking data can result in space needs being severely underestimated. Based on the previous work, we hypothesized the magnitude of underestimation varies with body mass, a relationship that could have serious conservation implications. To evaluate this hypothesis for terrestrial mammals, we estimated home-range areas with global positioning system (GPS) locations from 757 individuals across 61 globally distributed mammalian species with body masses ranging from 0.4 to 4000 kg. We then applied block cross-validation to quantify bias in empirical home-range estimates. Area requirements of mammals <10 kg were underestimated by a mean approximately15%, and species weighing approximately100 kg were underestimated by approximately50% on average. Thus, we found area estimation was subject to autocorrelation-induced bias that was worse for large species. Combined with the fact that extinction risk increases as body mass increases, the allometric scaling of bias we observed suggests the most threatened species are also likely to be those with the least accurate home-range estimates. As a correction, we tested whether data thinning or autocorrelation-informed home-range estimation minimized the scaling effect of autocorrelation on area estimates. Data thinning required an approximately93% data loss to achieve statistical independence with 95% confidence and was, therefore, not a viable solution. In contrast, autocorrelation-informed home-range estimation resulted in consistently accurate estimates irrespective of mass. When relating body mass to home range size, we detected that correcting for autocorrelation resulted in a scaling exponent significantly >1, meaning the scaling of the relationship changed substantially at the upper end of the mass spectrum.",

		"abstract": "Within a species, home-range size can vary due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this study we test the hypotheses that social group sizes (intrinsic) of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and food availability in their habitat (extrinsic) affect their home-range sizes. We used the minimum convex polygon method to estimate home-range sizes and core areas (the area in which each group was present during all seasons). Home-range size estimates varied from 11.3 ha to 27.6 ha ( ha ± 1.89 SE). Core area accounted for a mean 22.5% of the total home-range size. Home ranges measured during autumn and winter were significantly larger than those recorded in spring and summer. The correlation between home-range size and mean number of adults in groups was marginally significant, whereas that between home-range size and the overall average group size was not significant. We observed a significant negative linear correlation between home-range size and estimators of food availability. The evidence that we determined does not allow us to establish any relationship between group size and home-range size, but it lends support to the hypothesis that the abundance of food resources is a major limiting factor in determining home-range size.",

		"abstract": "The idea that groups of individuals may develop around resource patches led to the formulation of the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH). We tested the predictions of the RDH, within a quasi-experimental framework, using Australia’s largest terrestrial predator, the dingo Canis lupus dingo. Average dingo group sizes were higher in areas with abundant focal food sources around two mine sites compared with those in more distant areas. This supports the notion that resource richness favours larger group size, consistent with the RDH. Irrespective of season or sex, average home range estimates and daily activity for dingoes around the mine sites were significantly less than for dingoes that lived well away. Assuming that a territory is the defended part of the home range and that territory size is correlated with home range size, consistent with the RDH, the spatial dispersion of food patches therefore determined territory size for dingoes in our study. However, although sample size was small, some dingoes that accessed the supplementary food resource at the mines also spent a large proportion of their time away, suggesting a breakdown of territorial defence around the focal food resource. This, in combination with the large variation in home range size among dingoes that accessed the same supplementary food resource, limits the predictive capabilities of the RDH for this species. We hypothesize that constraints on exclusive home range occupancy will arise if a surfeit of food resources (in excess of requirements for homeostasis) is available in a small area, and that this will have further effects on access to mates and social structure. We present a conceptual model of facultative territorial defence where focal resources are available to demonstrate our findings.",

		"abstract": "One of the most striking aspects of animal groups is their remarkable variation in size, both within and between species. While a number of mechanistic models have been proposed to explain this variation, there are few comprehensive datasets against which these models have been tested. In particular, we only vaguely understand how environmental factors and behavioral activities affect group-size distributions. Here we use observations of House sparrows (Passer domesticus) to investigate the factors determining group-size distribution. Over a wide range of conditions, we observed that animal group sizes followed a single parameter distribution known as the logarithmic distribution. This single parameter is the mean group size experienced by a randomly chosen individual (including the individual itself). For sparrows, the experienced mean group size, and hence the distribution, was affected by four factors: morning temperature, place, behavior and the degree of food spillage. Our results further indicate that the sparrows regulate the mean group size they experience, either by groups splitting more or merging less when local densities are high. We suggest that the mean experienced group size provides a simple but general tool for assessing the ecology and evolution of grouping.",

		"abstract": "Statistical distributions like the negative binomial distribution are commonly used to describe aggregation patterns in animals. However, recently it has been suggested that truncated power laws (TPLs) may also be used for this kind of analysis. A TPL consists of two power functions separated by a cut-off size (C*). The cut-off size and the slope of power function one (β1) for the smallest group sizes have been suggested to have a biological explanatory value. We applied TPLs to aggregation data of tephritid seed predators on a composite plant, aphids on willows and grey seals on a haulout site. β1 varied between 0.60 and and −0.72, which is higher than predicted. In addition, resource distribution and animal density influenced β1 and C*. This indicates that environmental dimensionality suggested to affect β1 is masked by ecological factors. We conclude that TPLs are useful due to their simplicity and, in comparison with traditional methods, provide additional biologically relevant information. Truncated power laws can therefore prove to be useful in studies of animal behaviour and population dynamics.",

		"abstract": "Ungulates (antelopes, deer and relatives) have some of the most diverse social systems among mammals. To understand the evolution of ungulate social organization, Jarman (1974) proposed an ecological scenario of how distribution of resources, habitat and feeding style may have influenced social organization. Although Jarman's scenario makes intuitive sense and remains a textbook example of social evolution, it has not been scrutinized using modern phylogenetic comparative methods. Here we use 230 ungulate species from ten families to test Jarman's hypotheses using phylogenetic analyses. Consistent with Jarman's proposition, both habitat and feeding style predict group size, since grazing ungulates typically live in open habitats and form large herds. Group size, in turn, has a knock-on effect on mating systems and sexual size dimorphism, since ungulates that live in large herds exhibit polygamy and extensive sexual size dimorphism. Phylogenetic confirmatory path analyses suggest that evolutionary changes in habitat type, feeding style and body size directly (or indirectly) induce shifts in social organization. Taken together, these phylogenetic comparative analyses confirm Jarman's conjectures, although they also uncover novel relationships between ecology and social organization. Further studies are needed to explore the relevance of Jarman (1974) scenario for mammals beyond ungulates.",

		"abstract": "This paper combines theory from ecology and anthropology to investigate variation in the territory sizes of subsistence oriented agricultural societies. The results indicate that population and the dependence of individuals within a society on “wild” foods partly determine the territory sizes of agricultural societies. In contrast, the productivity of an agroecosystem is not an important determinant of territory size. A comparison of the population-territory size scaling dynamics of agricultural societies and human foragers indicates that foragers and farmers face the same constraints on their ability to expand their territory and intensify their use of resources within a territory. However, the higher density of food in an agroecosystem allows farmers, on average, to live at much higher population densities than human foragers. These macroecological patterns are consistent with a “work-around hypothesis” for the adoption of farming. This hypothesis is that as residential groups of foragers increase in size, farming can sometimes better reduce the tension between an individual’s autonomy over resources and the need for social groups to function to provide public goods like defense and information.",

Metabolic needs are calculated from published records of group structure, time spent in different activities and the metabolic costs of those activities. Data from 20 species demonstrate clear relationships between home range, diet and metabolic needs. Although correlations are in the expected directions, simple models relating diet to home range size and metabolic needs do not predict the functional relationships found. This may be because the data are inadequate or because the models are wrong.

We used data from 12 female and 8 male adult lions instrumented with GPS radio-collars to describe the ranging behaviour of lions in a population from a dystrophic semi-arid savanna, Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We measured prey availability at the home range scale in 2003, 2004, and 2005. For females, home range size increased as pride biomass increased, which is strongly suggestive of expansionism. Once controlled for pride biomass, home range size decreased as prey biomass increased. Pride ranges responded to changes in food abundance on an annual timescale rather than on a seasonal timescale. Female home range size was influenced by the abundance of kudu in the early dry season, whereas it was influenced by buffalo and young elephant abundance in the late dry season. This study shows that female home range size is mainly driven by the size of the pride, but also by prey abundance. Furthermore, female seasonal home range size may be determined, not only by prey abundance, but also by prey dispersion in the landscape. Home range size of males was driven by both prey biomass and the density of female prides.",

The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.",

		"abstract": "Understanding and predicting the composition and spatial structure of communities is a central challenge in ecology. An important structural property of animal communities is the distribution of individual home ranges. Home range formation is controlled by resource heterogeneity, the physiology and behaviour of individual animals, and their intra- and interspecific interactions. However, a quantitative mechanistic understanding of how home range formation influences community composition is still lacking. To explore the link between home range formation and community composition in heterogeneous landscapes we combine allometric relationships for physiological properties with an algorithm that selects optimal home ranges given locomotion costs, resource depletion and competition in a spatially-explicit individual-based modelling framework. From a spatial distribution of resources and an input distribution of animal body mass, our model predicts the size and location of individual home ranges as well as the individual size distribution (ISD) in an animal community. For a broad range of body mass input distributions, including empirical body mass distributions of North American and Australian mammals, our model predictions agree with independent data on the body mass scaling of home range size and individual abundance in terrestrial mammals. Model predictions are also robust against variation in habitat productivity and landscape heterogeneity. The combination of allometric relationships for locomotion costs and resource needs with resource competition in an optimal foraging framework enables us to scale from individual properties to the structure of animal communities in heterogeneous landscapes. The proposed spatially-explicit modelling concept not only allows for detailed investigation of landscape effects on animal communities, but also provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which resource competition in space shapes animal communities.",

		"abstract": "The fact that most female primates (and many other mammals) live in groups is paradoxical, given that the presence of others presumably increases competition for foods and may, for some, reduce reproductive success. Competition for food resources is generally inferred from any of the following observations: (1) female dominance hierarchies within groups; (2) female aggression between groups; (3) increasing home-range size with increasing group size; (4) longer day-range length with increasing group size; and (5) lower reproductive rates in larger groups. Both female aggression (interference competition) and adjustments of ranging behavior to group size (exploitative competition) have been linked in the past to patterns of food distribution and abundance. Using data largely from the literature, this paper examines the covariance of female aggression and ranging behavior among 20 species of primates in an attempt to better explain the variation in female relationships within and between groups of primates. Results show that groups of females are aggressive toward other groups and that home-range size increases with increasing group size in most species. In addition, in those species with strong dominance hierarchies within groups, day-range length increases as a function of group size. However, in those species that do not have strong dominance hierarchies within groups, dayrange length does not increase as a function of group size. The implications of these results are presented in a model that suggests that intergroup competition is determined by food abundance, whereas intragroup competition is determined by food distribution. This model differs from earlier models in its explanation of the ecological conditions that influence female relationships within and between groups of primates. [Behav Ecol 1991;2:143–155]",

		"abstract": "Among primates, group size is highly variable. The standard ecological model assumes that better predation avoidance as group size increases favours living in larger groups, whereas increased travel costs and reduced net food intake due to within-group competition for resources set the upper limit. Folivorous primates, however, tend to defy this generalisation in that some live in small groups despite low costs of feeding competition. To resolve this ’folivore paradox’, it has been suggested that folivore group size is limited by social factors such as male harassment or infanticide, or that females can disperse more easily and thus maintain group size near optimum levels. In this paper, we examine the effects of group size on home range size, day-journey length, activity budget and diet in wild Thomas’s langurs (Presbytis thomasi), which live in one-male multi-female groups with a limited life cycle. We examined only data from the stable middle tenure phase when factors such as the strength of the breeding male or the way in which groups were formed did not influence ranging and activities. During this phase, group size affected day-journey length and home range size, and had a minor effect on diet, but did not influence time spent feeding or resting, allogrooming or birth rates. Hence the upper limit to group size during the middle tenure phase in Thomas’s langurs is not set by feeding competition. The folivore paradox is not due to frequent female dispersal in Thomas’s langurs. The timing of female dispersal is not as expected if it serves to keep group sizes near the ecological optimum, and groups seem to be below this optimum. Instead, female reproductive success is presumably maximised in small to mid-sized groups because larger groups show a clear trend to experience higher risk of take-over, often accompanied by infanticide. Because females can redistribute themselves among nearby groups when groups reorganise each time a new male starts up a new group, females can keep the group small. Thus, a social factor, risk of infanticide, seems to provide the selective advantage to small group size in Thomas’s langurs.",

		"abstract": "Researchers consider group size in primates to be determined by complex relationships among numerous ecological forces. Antipredator benefits and better resource defense are the primary pressures for large groups. Conversely, intragroup limited food availability, can result in greater intragroup feeding competition and individual energy expenditure in larger groups, creating energetic advantages for individuals in small groups and placing an upper limit group size. However, the extent to which food availability constrains group size remains unclear for many species, including black howlers (Alouatta pigra), which ubiquitously live in small social groups (≤10 individuals). We studied the relationship between group size and 2 key indices of feeding competition—day journey length and activity budgets—in 3 groups of wild Alouatta pigra at a hurricane-damaged site in Belize, Central America. We controlled for differences in food availability between home ranges (food tree density) and compared both indicators of feeding competition directly with temporal variation in food availability for each group. Our results show no consistent association between resource availability, group size, and either index of competition, indicating that feeding competition does not limit group size at the site—i.e., that larger groups can form without increased costs of feeding competition. The results support the search for other explanations, possibly social ones, for small group size in the primates, and we conclude with suggestions and evidence for such alternative explanations.",

		"abstract": "Determinants of group size in species that feed on markedly different types of foods: the folivorous red colobus and the frugivorous/insectivorousred-tailed guenon are explored and group size increased with food tree density across sites for both species. The ecological constraints model proposes that an increase in group size will increase intragroup feeding competition and thereby constrain group size. Although this model has received wide acceptance, tests of it are based only on a few studies of species that have similar ecological requirements and social organizations, and there are reasons to question the widespread acceptance of the assumptions underpinning it. Via a 2-year study, we explored determinants of group size in species that feed on markedly different types of foods: the folivorous red colobus (Procolobus pennantii) and the frugivorous/insectivorous red-tailed guenon (Cercopithecus ascanius). We established 4 study sites approximately 15 km apart in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to examine the relationship between average group size and food availability. In both species, we quantified interdemic variation in diet, density of food trees, rate of travel, and group size. Red colobus at all sites relied heavily on leaf resources (75.5%–86.9%), but fruit (6.4%–13.9%) and flowers (2.0%–13.9%) were important in some populations. In general, red-tailed guenons fed on fruit (35.7%–59.7%), insects (14.5%–17.6%), and young leaves (12.2%–32.8%), but the amount of time allocated to these foods varied among sites. Average monthly density of trees bearing food items ranged among sites from 45 to 79 trees/ha for red colobus and from 19.6 to 67.3 trees/ha for red-tailed guenons. For both species, rate of travel was similar among sites, with one exception for red colobus. Average red colobus group size varied among sites from 14 to 40 (28 groups counted). Red-tailed guenon group size varied among sites from 11 to 24 (16 groups counted). As predicted by the ecological constraints model, group size increased with food tree density across sites for both species.",

Group size is predicted to increase with both food density and travel capabilities, as estimated by the “constraint-free day-range” (DRs), i.e. the day-range of a solitary individual uninfluenced by competition from conspecifics. We test this “exploitation competition” hypothesis among primates and carnivores, using data on populations, species and genera. Food density was indexed by population density. Where DRs could be estimated by regression it was found to be correlated with observed day-range (DRm). DRs was therefore indexed by DRm in all species. Population density and DRm were associated with each other, but in a multiple regression each variable contributed independently to explaining variation in group size. PGS was predicted better than FGS, but regressions involving either measure of group size were significant in all analyses. The multiple regression analyses were validated by the method of linear contrasts, which accounts for possible lack of independence among taxa. We conclude that species differences in group size are influenced by both food density and DRs. This suggests that variation in the intensity of exploitation competition is partly responsible for differences in group size.",

		"abstract": "Mechanistic models suggest that individuals' memories could shape home range patterns and dynamics, and how neighbours share space. In social species, such dynamics of home range overlap may be affected by the pre-dispersal memories of immigrants. We tested this \"immigrant knowledge hypothesis\" in a wild population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We predicted that overlap dynamics with a given neighbouring troop's home range should reflect males' adaptive interests in overlap when the alpha male had immigrated from this neighbouring troop but less so when the alpha male originated from elsewhere. We used data collected between 2005 and 2013 on two neighbouring troops in Namibia, comprising GPS records of daily ranges, male natal origins, daily females' reproductive status, and a satellite index of vegetation growth. We found support for our prediction in line with male reproductive strategies but not in line with foraging conditions. In periods with a higher relative number of fertile females over adult males in the focal troop, male baboons would benefit from reducing overlap with their neighbours to mitigate the costs of between-troop mating competition. This was indeed observed but only when the alpha male of the focal troop was an immigrant from that neighbouring troop, and not with alpha males of other origins, presumably due to their different knowledge of the neighbouring troop. Our findings highlight the role of reproductive competition in the range dynamics of social groups, and suggest that spatial segregation between groups could increase through the combination of dispersal and memory.",

In particular, it has been predicted that there is an energetically optimal body size (M*) for terrestrial mammals at ∼100 g, and that the relationships of many biological characteristics will change slope or even sign at this point. We reanalyze a well-known data set on the relationship between home range size and body size in mammals. If the distribution of home range sizes as a function of body size is energetically constrained, then it is reasonable to assume that the lower size limit of a home range for a given body mass will also be constrained. To evaluate this hypothesis, we predicted that the relationship between minimal home range size and body size is nonlinear, and that the smallest home ranges should correspond to species in the vicinity of M*. Our data tentatively support both hypotheses but constitute a clear call for more comprehensive analyses with larger data sets.",

Male aye-ayes were recently identified as having an insectivorous diet despite weighing 2.5 kg. We further explored this diet/body size disparity by studying behaviors of an adult female and juvenile male aye-aye. Materials and Methods We collected behavioral data on an adult female and juvenile male aye-aye in Torotorofotsy, Madagascar from January 2016 to December 2017. We used instantaneous sampling to determine the frequency of feeding events and continuous sampling during feeding behaviors to assess duration of feeding bouts. Results Invertebrates comprised over 88% of the diet for both animals. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test found no significant difference in the female's feeding frequencies between the hot/rainy seasons and the cold/dry seasons. Discussion Our results support earlier findings that invertebrates are the aye-aye's main resource and corroborate that aye-ayes violate assumptions of the Jarman/Bell model and Kay's threshold. We suggest that the Jarman/Bell principle and Kay's threshold be used as supporting evidence and not to repudiate findings that do not conform to these guidelines.",

		"abstract": "The fossil record of primates provides our only direct evidence of the course of evolution leading to the present diversity of primate species, and about the nature of extinct forms which died without issue. Three goals of palaeoprimatological research are identifiable: (1) to identify and name extinct species and to determine their geographical and temporal distribution; (2) to analyze the associations among the species and reconstruct a picture of their phylogeny; and (3) finally, to clarify in functional and adaptive terms the observed morphology and morphological trends among the species and groups of species. Aspects of this last goal are the subject of this paper, where we outline a possible approach to the assessment of the morphology of species which allows their adaptations to be reconstructed. We can thereby provide a series of adaptive models based on living primates which can form the basis for interpreting the morphology of extinct primates.",

		"abstract": "An animal’s use of space may be strongly influenced by habitat edges and neighboring conspecifics encountered in and around its home range. Habitat edges are known to affect species density and distribution, but their impact on home range use is largely unknown. Additionally, among large animals, interactions with neighbors become particularly important as increasing home range size leads to decreasing exclusivity of resource use, but the effect of neighbors on home range use remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the influence of neighbors and habitat edges on the ranging patterns of three groups of Phayre’s leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus) in northeast Thailand over a period of more than 2 years. The study animals occupied dry evergreen forest, and adjacent patches of dry dipterocarp forest created a habitat edge and formed barriers between some groups. We found that the use of home range interiors was 50–90% higher than the border areas, indicating concentrated use of resources within the home range. The use of peripheral areas was influenced by social organization, the presence of neighboring groups, and forest edges. While one multimale group showed no particular habitat preference, two single-male groups preferred areas bordering dry dipterocarp habitat and avoided areas bordering neighboring groups, suggesting that the threat of neighbors mediated border presence. Additionally, groups may have been attracted to the forest edge, where conspecific competitors are absent and increased sunlight may increase resource abundance and/or quality. This study revealed that the use of border areas can be modulated by neighboring groups and habitat edges, thereby adding to our understanding of home range use among territorial species in heterogeneous habitats.",

		"abstract": "Although many studies employ allometric relationships to demonstrate possible dependence of various traits on body mass, the relationship between home range size and body mass has been perhaps the most difficult to understand. Early studies demonstrated that carnivorous species had larger home ranges than herbivorous species of similar mass. These studies also argued that scaling relations (e.g., slopes) of the former were steeper than those of the latter and explained this in terms of the distribution of food resources, which are more uniformly distributed for most herbivores than for carnivores. In contrast to these studies, we show that scaling relations of home ranges for carnivorous mammals do not differ significantly from those of herbivorous and omnivorous species and that all three exhibit slopes that are significantly steeper than predicted on the basis of energetic requirements. We also demonstrate that home range size is constrained to fit within a polygonal constraint space bounded by lines representing energetic and/or biophysical limitations, which suggests that the log‐linear relationship between home range area and mass may not be the appropriate function to compare against the energetically predicted slopes of 0.75 or 1.0. It remains unclear, however, why the slope of the relationship between home range area and body mass, whether based on raw data or on constraint lines, always exceeds that predicted by the energetic needs hypothesis.",

		"abstract": "AbstractDaily animal movements are usually limited to a discrete home range area that scales allometrically with body size, suggesting that home-range size is shaped by metabolic rates and energy availability across species. However, there is little understanding of the relative importance of the various mechanisms proposed to influence home-range scaling (e.g., differences in realm productivity, thermoregulation, locomotion strategy, dimensionality, trophic guild, and prey size) and whether these extend beyond the commonly studied birds and mammals. We derive new home-range scaling relationships for fishes and reptiles and use a model-selection approach to evaluate the generality of home-range scaling mechanisms across 569 vertebrate species. We find no evidence that home-range allometry varies consistently between aquatic and terrestrial realms or thermoregulation strategies, but we find that locomotion strategy, foraging dimension, trophic guild, and prey size together explain 80% of the variation in home-range size across vertebrates when controlling for phylogeny and tracking method. Within carnivores, smaller relative prey size among gape-limited fishes contributes to shallower scaling relative to other predators. Our study reveals how simple morphological traits and prey-handling ability can profoundly influence individual space use, which underpins broader-scale patterns in the spatial ecology of vertebrates.",

		"abstract": "Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.\n”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)",

		"abstract": "Intraspecific variation in territory size and shape can have strong effects on population structure and dynamics. The traditional theoretical approach to the study of territory size is based on optimality models that analyze decisions of focal residents as responses to the costs and benefits of defense. These models have stimulated numerous empirical studies showing that territory holders adjust their behavior according to rates of intrusion and availability of food. However, models of optimal territory size are applicable only in limited circumstances because they focus on unilateral decisions rather than on interactions. Furthermore, observational and experimental studies often find that territory sizes are insensitive to food supply. Recently, greater emphasis has been placed on two alternative approaches. The first concerns interactions among contiguous neighbors and how these affect use of space. In these models territory size and shape are determined by the balance of pressure exerted at boundaries or arise as the results of local rules of movement and interaction. The second alternative approach views territory size as the outcome of interactions between established residents and potential settlers attempting to acquire territories. By considering the simultaneous actions of multiple competitors, these models allow quantitative prediction of the effects of territory defense on population density and spatial patterns as well as responses to environmental change.",

Advances in animal tracking technology, theoretical movement models and cognitive sciences have facilitated research in each of these fields, but also created a need for synthetic examination of the linkages between memory and animal movement. Here, we draw together research from several disciplines to understand the relationship between animal memory and movement processes. First, we frame the problem in terms of the characteristics, costs and benefits of memory as outlined in psychology and neuroscience. Next, we provide an overview of the theories and conceptual frameworks that have emerged from behavioural ecology and animal cognition. Third, we turn to movement ecology and summarise recent, rapid developments in the types and quantities of available movement data, and in the statistical measures applicable to such data. Fourth, we discuss the advantages and interrelationships of diverse modelling approaches that have been used to explore the memory-movement interface. Finally, we outline key research challenges for the memory and movement communities, focusing on data needs and mathematical and computational challenges. We conclude with a roadmap for future work in this area, outlining axes along which focused research should yield rapid progress.",

As data have accumulated on life-history patterns of nonhuman primates, comparative studies have yielded important insights into the evolution of this slow life-history style of primates. However, in order to understand selection pressures and evolutionary potential within species, it is important to complement comparative studies with detailed studies of life-history variability within species and to identify sources of this variability. Here we present a summary of how foraging environment, social status, and group size (a measure of population density) contribute to within-population variance in reproductive success for savannah baboons. We also discuss the extent to which savannah baboons, with their highly flexible and adaptable behavior, change their foraging environments by shifting home ranges and seeking rich food sources and how low-ranking females, which disproportionately bear the costs of social life, may mitigate those costs.",

As part of a broader study of grey-cheeked mangabey,Lophocebus albigena , dispersal in Kibale National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27 radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from ‘isolated’ (≥200m from the group) males with data from ‘within-group’ males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found isolated only 11% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results suggest that dispersing males may not face increased risk of starvation, but are at higher risk of mortality (primarily through predation by eagles) than nondispersing males.",

		"abstract": "Current theory frames animal dispersal as an outcome of potentially complex, multi-factorial interactions and tradeoffs that may vary across individual, sex, rank, age, social group, species, habitat and time. Empirical data relevant to a broad range of the potential costs and benefits incurred by dispersal are, not surprisingly, limited for many mammals and other vertebrates. Here we present the first report on dispersal in a wild population of the Neotropical primate Saimiri sciureus (Primates: Cebidae). Long-term observations (1998-2001) of this squirrel monkey represent part of a broader study of the forest community at Raleighvallen in the Central Suriname Nature Reserve. These new dispersal records for S. sciureus are combined with comparable information from congeners, S. boliviensis in Peru and S. oerstedii in Costa Rica. The resulting three-way compilation includes the ecological, social and mating context for each congener. Further enhancing the inherent phylogenetic control of a within-genus comparison, these data were collected with the explicit intent of joint analyses, and the study sites for these small, arboreal social mammals are three of the least disturbed extant Neotropical forests in the historical record. Saimiri appears to merit description as the genus with the most diverse set of species dispersal patterns yet documented among mammals. (1) S. sciureus of both sexes undertake dispersal on several to many occasions during their lifetime. Females and immatures commonly transfer between troops. The large portion of male S. sciureus spend their adult years as solitary or peripheral males. Few males attain secure residence in a mixed-sex troop, a prerequisite for mating success. (2) On attainment of sexual maturity, male S. boliviensis emigrate with their same-age cohort, first joining all-male bands, and eventually entering mixedsex troops with this same natal male birth cohort. Natal female S. boliviensis are philopatric and form cohesive matrilines. Within-troop competition determines each matriline's priority of access to fruit resources. (3) In contrast to both S. sciureus and S. boliviensis, S. oerstedii males are philopatric and maintain tight affiliation with same age-cohort males. Natal female S. oerstedii emigrate as juveniles prior to their first mating season, and may undertake secondary dispersals in subsequent years. Squirrel monkeys represent a genus with realistic prospects of discriminating the costs and benefits germane to species-typical dispersal strategies. To this end, we collate 30 different causal parameters commonly invoked as influencing mammalian dispersal patterns. Each of these factors is assessed separately for possible influence on the empirically determined sex and species differences. We predict the possible consequences of direct and inclusive fitness interactions on dispersal outcomes for future testing with genetic data. Components ofSaimiri selective regimes particularly salient to female dispersal strategies include food competition, foraging benefits provided by kin and inbreeding avoidance. Dispersal patterns among male Saimiri are constrained by mate competition and the consequent reproductive skew, in addition to enhanced predation risk during dispersal forays. Little evidence, however, suggests that relative to familiar landscapes, exploitation of novel ranging areas substantially increases foraging costs or predation risk for dispersing squirrel monkeys of either sex. We then compare the species-specific dispersal regimes initially identified with the univariate array of proposed costs and benefits to the tradeoffs predicted by a selection of contemporary multivariate dispersal models. The multivariate models did not, however, improve substantially upon the collective insights on cost-benefit regimes achieved with the univariate hypotheses...

		"abstract": "Male vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, disperse nonrandomly from their natal groups at sexual maturity, and migrate to specific neighboring groups with their brothers or peers. Nonrandom dispersal in the company of allies appears to benefit young males by minimizing the risk of predation and reducing the probability of attack by resident males and females. Nonrandom dispersal also decreases the likelihood of mating with close female kin. Persistent nonrandom transfer, however, increases the risk of inbreeding depression. We emphasize the importance of considering social, as well as genetic, factors when evaluating the costs and benefits of any pattern of dispersal. In certain cases, there may be social advantages to a particular dispersal pattern even though it appears initially to carry some genetic costs. In other cases, a dispersal pattern that at first appears to increase the risk of inbreeding may in fact permit individuals to avoid mating with close kin. Finally, the benefits of a given pattern of dispersal may change markedly during an individual's life. While males seem to benefit by transferring nonrandomly with their peers when young, it may be more advantageous for older males to disperse alone. Age-related changes in the social benefits of nonrandom transfer appear to have important genetic consequences for the population as a whole.",

		"abstract": "The view is examined that the adaptive value of conventional aspects of fighting behaviour is for assessment of relative RHP (resource holding power) of the combatants. Outcomes of aggressive disputes should be decided by each individual's fitness budget available for expenditure during a fight (determined by the fitness difference between adoption of alternative strategies, escalation or withdrawal without escalation) and on the rate of expenditure of the fitness budget if escalation occurs (determined by the RHPs of the combatants). Thus response thresholds for alternative strategies (“assessments”) will be determined by natural selection on a basis of which opponent is likely to expend its fitness budget first, should escalation occur. This “loser” should retreat (before escalation) and the winner should stay in possession of the resource. Many aggressive decisions depend on whether one is a resource holder, or an attacker. Assuming the RHP of the combatants to be equal, there are many instances of fitness pay-off imbalances between holder and attacker which should weight the dispute outcome in favour of one or other opponent by allowing it a greater expendable fitness budget. Usually the weighting favours the holder; the attacker therefore needs a correspondingly higher RHP before it may be expected to win. This is not invariably the case, and much observed data fits the predictions of this sort of model. If assessments are perfect and budget expenditure rates exactly predictable, then there would never seem to be any case for escalation. Escalation can be explained in terms of injury inflictions (expenditures) occurring as discrete events; i.e. as “bouts” won or lost during fighting. Assessment can give only a probabilistic prediction of the outcome of a bout. A simple model is developed to investigate escalation situations. Each combatant assesses relative RHP; this correlates with an absolute probability of winning the next bout (cabs). The stake played for is infliction of loss of RHP and is determined by the fitness budgets of the opponents. (Each individual plays for the withdrawal of its opponent.) This defines a critical probability of winning (ccrit) for each combatant, above which escalation is the favourable strategy (cabs > ccrit) and below which withdrawal is favourable (cabs < ccrit). Escalation should occur only where cabs-ccrit is positive for both combatants. This model gives predictions compatible with the observations, indicating that RHP loss alone can be adequate to explain withdrawal: escalation behaviour. Withdrawal tendency will be increased by low searching costs. Escalations should be restricted to closely matched RHP opponents if RHP disparity is the major imbalance. Outside the “escalation range” of a given individual, the higher RHP individual wins and the lower one loses (i.e. it should withdraw after conventional display). RHP disparity and holder: attacker imbalance should both interact to shape the observed pattern, though their relative importances will depend on species and situation. In some instances selection may favour immediate withdrawal from an occupied territory even without assessment of RHP.",

		"abstract": "Understanding patterns of animal space use and range fidelity has important implications for species and habitat conservation. For species that live in highly seasonal environments, such as mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), spatial use patterns are expected to vary in relation to seasonal changes in environmental conditions and sex- or age-specific selection pressures. To address hypotheses about sex, age, and seasonality influence on space-use ecology, we collected GPS location data from 263 radio-collared mountain goats (males, n = 140; females, n = 123) in coastal Alaska during 2005–2016. Location data were analyzed to derive seasonal and sex-specific fixed-kernel home range estimates and to quantify the degree of seasonal range and utilization distribution overlap. Overall, we determined that home range size was smallest during winter, expanded coincident with the onset of green-up and parturition, and was largest during summer. Home range size of males and females did not differ significantly during winter, but females had larger home ranges than males during summer, a relationship that was switched during the mating season. Pairwise comparisons involving individual females across subsequent years indicated home ranges were significantly smaller during years when they gave birth to offspring. Mountain goats exhibited a strong degree of range fidelity, and 99% (n = 138) of individual animals returned to their previous year's seasonal range with an average annual Bhattacharyya's affinity utilization distribution overlap index of 68%. Similarity of seasonal home range utilization distributions varied in relation to sex and season in some respects. Home range overlap was highest during the summer vegetation growing season, particularly among females. These findings advance our understanding about how environmental variation and sex- and age-related reproductive constraints influence space use and range fidelity among alpine ungulates. Documentation of the high degree of range fidelity among mountain goats has important conservation implications in landscapes increasingly altered by anthropogenic activities.",

		"abstract": "Territory size can be considered as the outcome of contests between an owner and its neighbours for the resource units in the defended area. Variation in territory size could be dependent upon three possible asymmetries: (1) difference in resource holding potential (RHP); (2) difference in resource value to the competitors; and (3) difference in ‘ownership’ status. These possibilities were tested in a 3-year study of moorhens which defend linear territories along ditches in a grazing marsh habitat. Of the three, relative difference in RHP between an owner and its two neighbours provided the best correlation with territory size. There was no relationship between the amount of resources per unit area and territory size nor between the time of establishing a territory and its later size. Heavier moorhens are more likely to win contests in winter flocks and are thought to have a greater RHP. The ratio of the weight of a male territory owner to the weight of both its male neighbours was highly correlated with territory size. Birds with larger territories may gain more potential nesting sites with good cover from predators.",

		"abstract": "Many aggressive animals form territory mosaics marked by distinct boundaries. This paper describes an approach to modeling territory size and shape within mosaics based on boundary disputes among neighboring animals. The model assumes that each resident applies pressure against its neighbors, as a result of aggression and display, and that boundaries form curves along which the pressure exerted by adjacent residents is equal. To illustrate, I predicted territory boundaries for populations of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta using several alternative mathematical descriptions of territorial fighting. According to the most successful formula, the aggressive pressure applied at any point on the territory perimeter increases linearly with the biomass of the defending colony but decreases with territory area and with the square of the distance to the colony's nest. An iterative algorithm predicts the size and location of boundary segments given the positions and sizes of colonies. By all measured criteria, this model produced more accurate predictions of territory areas and shapes than alternative models that omit the effects of resident size or the dependence of aggressive pressure on territory area. Modifications can incorporate nest relocations, strategic variation in the degree of aggressive pressure applied, habitat heterogeneity, and other biological details. However, even with simple assumptions, the model predicts much of the variation in the sizes and shapes of fire ant territories in natural conditions. This implies that territories are molded by a balance of aggression between neighbors and that each territory is affected by the actions of numerous residents.",

		"abstract": "The effect of feeding competition on foraging efficiency is an important link between ecological factors and the social organization of gregarious species. We examined the effects of group size on daily travel distances, activity budgets, and energy intake of mountain gorillas in Rwanda. We measured daily travel distances of five groups, activity budgets of 79 gorillas in nine groups, and energy intake data for 23 adult females in three groups over a 16-month period. Travel distances and the proportion of time spent traveling increased with size for most groups, which would be expected if their foraging efficiency is limited by intragroup feeding competition. However, travel distances and times decreased for the largest group, which also had higher energy intake rates than intermediate sized groups. The improved foraging efficiency of the largest group may be explained by advantages in intergroup contest competition. The largest group had much lower home range overlap than the other study groups which may be due to groups avoiding one another as a result of male mating competition. Collectively, our results indicate that intermediate sized groups had the lowest foraging efficiency and provide a new twist on the growing evidence of non-linear relationships between group size and foraging efficiency in primates.",

		"abstract": "Seven major types of sampling for observational studies of social behavior have been found in the literature. These methods differ considerably in their suitability for providing unbiased data of various kinds. Below is a summary of the major recommended uses of each technique: State or Event Sampling Method Sampling Recommended Uses 1. Ad Libitum (p. 235) either Primarily of heuristic value; suggestive; records of rare but significant events. 2. Sociometric Matrix Completion (p. 240) event Asymmetry within dyads. 3. Focal-Animal (p. 242) either Sequential constraints; percent of time; rates; durations; nearest neighbor relationships. 4. All Occurrences of Some Behaviors (p. 247) usually event Synchrony; rates. 5. Sequence (p. 248) either Sequential constraints. 6. One-Zero (p. 251) usually state None. 7. Instantaneous and Scan (p. 258) state Percent of time; synchrony; subgroups. In this paper, I have tried to point out the major strengths and weaknesses of each sampling method. Some methods are intrinsically biased with respect to many variables, others to fewer. In choosing a sampling method the main question is whether the procedure results in a biased sample of the variables under study. A method can produce a biased sample directly, as a result of intrinsic bias with respect to a study variable, or secondarily due to some degree of dependence (correlation) between the study variable and a directly-biased variable. In order to choose a sampling technique, the observer needs to consider carefully the characteristics of behavior and social interactions that are relevant to the study population and the research questions at hand. In most studies one will not have adequate empirical knowledge of the dependencies between relevant variables. Under the circumstances, the observer should avoid intrinsic biases to whatever extent possible, in particular those that direcly affect the variables under study. Finally, it will often be possible to use more than one sampling method in a study. Such samples can be taken successively or, under favorable conditions, even concurrently. For example, we have found it possible to take Instantaneous Samples of the identities and distances of nearest neighbors of a focal individual at five or ten minute intervals during Focal-Animal (behavior) Samples on that individual. Often during Focal-Animal Sampling one can also record All Occurrences of Some Behaviors, for the whole social group, for categories of conspicuous behavior, such as predation, intergroup contact, drinking, and so on. The extent to which concurrent multiple sampling is feasible will depend very much on the behavior categories and rate of occurrence, the observational conditions, etc. Where feasible, such multiple sampling can greatly aid in the efficient use of research time.",

		"abstract": "In many social species, competition between groups is a major factor proximately affecting group-level movement patterns and space use and ultimately shaping the evolution of group living and complex sociality. Here we evaluated the factors influencing group-level dominance among 5 social groups of wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus), in particular focusing on the spatial determinants of dominance and the consequences of defeat. When direct conflict occurred between conspecific baboon groups, the winning group was predicted by differences in the number of adult males in each group and/or groups that had used the areas surrounding the encounter location more intensively than their opponent in the preceding 9 or 12 months. Relative intensity of space use over shorter timescales examined (3 and 6 months) was a poor predictor of the interaction's outcome. Losing groups but not winning groups experienced clear short-term costs. Losing groups used the area surrounding the interaction less following an agonistic encounter (relative to their intensity of use of the area prior to the interaction). These findings offer insight into the influences and consequences of intergroup competition on group-level patterns of space use.",

		"abstract": "The honey ant Myrmecocystus mimicus is a scavenger, forages extensively on termites, collects floral nectar, and tends homoptera. Individual foragers of M. mimicus usually disperse in all directions when leaving the nest, but there are also groups of foragers that tend to swarm out of the nest primarily in one direction. Such massive departures are usually at irregular intervals, which may last several hours. The results of field and laboratory experiments suggest that these swarms of foragers are organized by a group recruitment process, during which recruiting scout ants lay chemical orientation trails with hindgut contents and simultaneously stimulate nestmates with a motor display and secretions from the poison gland. Usually these columns travel considerable distances (4-48 m) away from the nest, frequently interfering with the foraging activity of conspecific neighboring colonies. To prevent a neighboring colony from access to temporal food sources or to defend spatiotemporal borders, opposing colonies engage in elaborate display tournaments. Although hundreds of ants are often involved during these tournaments almost no physical fights occur. Instead, individual ants confront each other in highly stereotyped aggressive displays, during which they walk on stilt legs while raising the gaster and head. Some of the ants even seem to inflate their gasters so that the tergites are raised and the whole gaster appears to be larger. In addition, ants involved in tournament activities are on average larger than foragers. The dynamics of the tournament interactions were observed in several colonies over several weeks - mapping each day the locations of the tournaments, the major directions of worker routes away from the nest, and recording the general foraging activities of the colonies. The results indicate that a kind of dominance order can occur among neighboring colonies. On the other hand, often no aggressive interactions among neighboring colonies can be observed, even though the colonies are actively foraging. In those cases the masses of foragers of each colony depart in one major direction that does not bring them into conflict with the masses of foragers of a neighboring colony. This stability, however, can be disturbed by offering a new rich food source to be exploited by two neighboring colonies. This invariably leads to tournament interactions. When a colony is considerably stronger than the other, i.e., with a much larger worker force, the tournaments end quickly and the weaker colony is raided. The foreign workers invade the nest, the queen of the resident colony is killed or driven off, while the larvae, pupae, callow workers, and honey pot workers are carried or dragged to the nest of the raiders. From these and other observations we conclude that young M. mimicus queens are unlikely to succeed in founding a colony within approximately 3 m of a mature M. mimicus colony because they are discovered and killed, or driven off by workers of the resident colony. Within approximately 3-15 m queens are more likely to start colonies, but these incipient groups run a high risk of being raided and exterminated by the mature colony. Although populations of M. mimicus and M. depilis tend to replace each other, there are areas where both species overlap marginally. Foraging areas and foraging habitats of both species also overlap broadly, but we never observed tournament interactions between M. mimicus and M. depilis. The adaptive significance of the spatiotemporal territories in M. mimicus is discussed.",

A midwinter increase in reply rate was correlated with the breeding season, especially for groups containing breeding animals. A second, longer increase in reply rate began in midsummer, peaked in August, and declined to a low in early winter. For wolves separated from their pack, the howling reply rate was dependent on their age and social role. Specific behaviors noted during howling sessions, including movements away from the howler, indicated that howling was related to interpack agonism. Three of the major factors influencing reply rate also significantly affected the level of agonism toward pack strangers—pack size, social role, and breeding season. Howling was most effective in mediating avoidance when 2 packs approached a common area of overlap and when a pack returned to an area little used for weeks, in which scent posts were ineffective in deterring strangers.

		"abstract": "Extensive observations of foraging female lions reveal that two group sizes maximize foraging success during the season of prey scarcity: one female and five or six females. Foraging success does not vary significantly with group size when prey is abundant. Female lions live in fission-fusion social units (prides) and forage only with members of their own pride. If lion grouping patterns were primarily related to group-size-specific feeding efficiency, females in prides containing fewer than five females should forage alone when prey is scarce, whereas females in larger prides should forage alone or in groups of five or six. However, extensive data on the grouping patterns of radio-collared females show that females in small prides most commonly forage in as large a group as possible, even at the expense of foraging efficiency. Females in large prides most often forage in intermediate group sizes of four or five. However, mothers keep their cubs in a creche and form highly stable maternity groups that are effective in defending the cubs against infanticidal males. Most large prides contain a creche involving four or five mothers, and in the absence of a creche, large prides show no preference for any group size. Females also compete aggressively against neighboring prides, and larger groups successfully repel smaller ones in territorial disputes. Small prides appear to be excessively gregarious in order to compete against larger neighboring prides.",

		"abstract": "By studying animal movements, researchers can gain insight into many of the ecological characteristics and processes important for understanding population-level dynamics. We developed a Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) for estimating the expected movement path of an animal, using discrete location data obtained at relatively short time intervals. The BBMM is based on the properties of a conditional random walk between successive pairs of locations, dependent on the time between locations, the distance between locations, and the Brownian motion variance that is related to the animal's mobility. We describe two critical developments that enable widespread use of the BBMM, including a derivation of the model when location data are measured with error and a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the Brownian motion variance. After the BBMM is fitted to location data, an estimate of the animal's probability of occurrence can be generated for an area during the time of observation. To illustrate potential applications, we provide three examples: estimating animal home ranges, estimating animal migration routes, and evaluating the influence of fine-scale resource selection on animal movement patterns.",

The continuous-time formulation allows data that have been nonuniformly collected over time to be modeled without subsampling, interpolation, or aggregation to obtain a set of locations uniformly spaced in time. The model is derived from a continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity process that is integrated to form a location process. The continuous-time model was placed into a state–space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents.",

		"abstract": "1 Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2 We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3 To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4 Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50%. 5 Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6 The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7 We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.",

		"abstract": "Studies of habitat selection and movements often use radio-tracking data for defining animal home ranges. Home ranges (HR) can be approximated by a utilization density distribution (UD) that instead of assuming uniform use of areas within HR boundary provides a probabilistic measure of animal space use. In reality, radio-tracking data contain periods of frequent autocorrelated observations interspersed with temporally more independent observations. Using such temporally irregular data directly may result in biased UD estimates, because areas that have been sampled intensively receive too much weight. The problem of autocorrelation has been tackled by resampling data with an appropriate time interval. However, resampling may cause a large reduction in the data set size along with a loss of information. Evidently, biased UD estimates or reduction in data may prejudice the results on animal habitat selection and movement. We introduce a new method for estimating UDs with temporally irregular data. The proposed method, called the time kernel, accounts for temporal aggregation of observations and gives less weight to temporally autocorrelated observations. A further extension of the method accounts also for spatially aggregated observations with relatively low weights given to observations that are both temporally and spatially aggregated. We test the behaviour of the time kernel method and its spatiotemporal version using simulated data. In addition, the method is applied to a data set of brown bear locations.",

(2) The best model can be chosen from a set of candidate models with the proper balance between fit and complexity.

Intensive sampling of the individual's home range and habitat use during the time frame of the study leads to improved estimates for the individual, but use of location estimates as the sample unit to compare across animals is pseudoreplication. We therefore recommend against use of habitat selection analysis techniques that use locations instead of individuals as the sample unit. We offer a general outline for sampling designs for radiotracking studies.",

		"abstract": "Animals are hypothesized to search their environments in predictable ways depending on the distribution of resources. Evenly distributed foods are thought to be best exploited with random Brownian movements; while foods that are patchy or unevenly distributed require non-Brownian strategies, such as Lévy walks. Thus, when food distribution changes due to seasonal variation, animals should show concomitant changes in their search strategies. We examined this issue in 6 monkey species from Africa and Mexico: 3 frugivores and 3 folivores. We hypothesized that the more patchily distributed fruit would result in frugivores showing more levy-like patterns of motion, while folivores, with their more homogenous food supply, would show Brownian patterns of motion. At least 3 and up to 5 of 6 species conformed to the overall movement pattern predicted by their primary dietary item. For folivorous black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra), ursine colobus (Colobus vellerosus), and red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus), Brownian movement was supported or could not be ruled-out. Two frugivores (spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis, and gray-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena) showed Lévy walks, as predicted, but frugivorous vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) showed a Brownian walk. Additionally, we test whether seasonal variation in the spatial availability of food support environmentally driven changes in movement patterns. Four of 5 species tested for seasonal variation showed adjustments in their search strategies between the rainy and dry seasons. This study provides support for the notion that food distribution determines search strategies and that animal movement patterns are flexible, mirroring changes in the environment.",

		"abstract": "Mountain gorillas are highly folivorous. Food is abundant and perennially available in much of their habitat. Still, limited research has shown that single gorilla groups heavily used areas where food biomass and quality were relatively high and where they met daily nutritional needs with relatively low foraging effort. Also, ecological factors influenced solitary males less than groups with females. Long-term data on habitat use by multiple mountain gorilla social units and more extensive data on variation in food distribution, presented here, confirm that food distribution influences areal occupation densities across groups and over time. These data also confirm the group/solitary male distinction and show that food distribution became more important for one male once he acquired females. Groups used ≤25 km2, and inter-annual home range and core area overlap was often low. Annual home range and core area size varied considerably within groups and across years. It bore no simple relationship to group size and estimated group biomass. Core areas were biased samples of total home ranges and were relatively good foraging areas. One group abruptly shifted its home range in response to male mating competition. Home ranges of two others expanded from 1981 to 1987, though at a decreasing rate. Data on one such group, which varied considerably in size, are consistent with arguments that costs of scramble competition are low except in unusually large groups. Low site fidelity, low scramble costs, and high home range overlap should decrease the ecological costs of female transfer.",

I studied a single social group of wild white-faced capuchins over a period of 26 months and observed 44 encounters between social groups during 3703 hr of observation. All intergroup encounters consisted of predominantly hostile social interactions. However, nonaggressive interactions between males of different social groups occurred in a few cases. Adult males were the sole participants in 39 encounters and the primary participants in all 44 encounters. The alpha male was the most frequent participant. High-ranking females participated aggressively in five encounters, and low-ranking females never participated. There was no stable intergroup dominance hierarchy. I hypothesize that the need for male-male cooperation in intergroup aggression is an important factor influencing the quality of intragroup male-male relationships. Behavior during intergroup encounters is consistent with the idea that intergroup behavior is related to male reproductive strategies, but inconsistent with the idea that intergroup aggression is related to female defense of resources. The possibility that males are “hired guns” (Wrangham, 1980) cannot be ruled out.",

		"abstract": "Site fidelity, the tendency to return to a previously occupied location, has been observed in numerous species belonging to at least three phyla. In this paper I develop a general model using dynamic programming to investigate conditions under which fidelity to a previously occupied territory will be advantageous. The results predict that site fidelity should be inversely related to heterogeneity in territory quality and the animal's lifespan and positively related to the cost of changing territories, age and probability of mortality in the habitat. The predictability of reproductive outcome (defined as the probability that next period's outcome will be the same as this period's outcome) also affects site fidelity. In predictable habitats, changing territories may be favoured after a bad previous outcome. In contrast, settlement should be independent of the previous outcome in unpredictable habitats. Individuals should also be site-faithful in unpredictable habitats, as long as the mean territory quality is equal among available territories. I also investigate the success of two potential decision rules ('always stay' and 'win-stay: lose-switch') relative to the optimal settlement strategy. The results show that these rules may perform as well as the optimal strategy under certain conditions. The always stay strategy does well in unpredictable habitats, when the mean quality within a territory is equal among territories. In contrast, the win-stay: lose-switch strategy performs best in predictable habitats.",

		"abstract": "Conservation of wide-ranging species and their mobility is a major challenge in an increasingly fragmented world. Species are traditionally viewed as static conservation targets and the importance of securing long-distance movement of individuals is still underappreciated in conservation and policy. Here, we investigated large carnivore movements in humanized landscapes of Europe. We describe the movement of 6 GPS-tracked male brown bears, including one of the longest dispersal events recorded in this species. We looked at the relationships of bear movement paths with country borders, roads, built-up areas and habitat composition. The daily distance of resident individuals was 5.5 ± 4.4 km and almost twice as long in the dispersing subadult (9.3 ± 6.4 km). Maximum displacement of the disperser was 360 km (compared to 43.3 ± 13.0 km in resident bears). The resident bears moved within less than 10 km to built-up areas, while the dispersing bear stayed mostly at larger distances. The bears also frequently crossed roads (0–31 per month) and state borders (0–14 per month). The dispersing bear moved through four countries. A review of 29 cases and studies of large carnivore long-distance movements in Europe showed that transboundary movement represented over 96% of all cases; 9 extended over different populations and 10 over recolonization areas. Most documented cases of long-distance dispersal (52% of 21 individual cases) ended with the death of the animal (82% of confirmed deaths were human-caused, 46% were legal killings) before it could reproduce. Reproduction was documented only in 2 of the individual cases. We emphasize high conservation value of long-distance dispersers in large carnivore populations and the need to reevaluate how they are viewed and managed. We urge to consider wide-ranging, transboundary movements in conservation policies.",

		"abstract": "Many species of vertebrates require multiple habitats to obtain different resources at different stages of their life-cycles. Use of habitat mosaics takes place on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, from a daily requirement for adjacent habitats to seasonal use of geographically separated environments. Mosaics of habitats are also required in some species to allow ontogenetic habitat shifts, while in others each sex may have specific requirements that are met by different habitats. The extent and nature of animal movements are key (but generally poorly known) factors affecting the vulnerability of species to landscape change. The requirement by many species for multiple habitats suggests that their conservation will be most effective in a mosaic environment and that protection of certain high profile habitats alone, such as rainforest, will be insufficient to achieve conservation goals. Management regimes that result in homogenization of habitats should be avoided. Priority should be given to research that identifies the extent to which species can locate habitat mosaics, at different spatial scales and arrangements, in modified environments.",

		"abstract": "Habitat loss, climate change, hunting perturbation, disease, invasive species, guild structure disruption and conflict are seven widespread threats to wildlife conservation, with the Carnivora standing at the apex of risk. Fundamental to all of these is the ability of organisms and ecosystems to adapt, else succumb, and it is the extent to which their behaviour is flexible and adaptable that may stand between viability and extinction. Knowledge gained through undertaking original research on aspects of fundamental biology and behaviour assists practitioners and policy makers in the management of conservation problems. Selecting examples of these seven threats from our projects at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU), I identify the conservation issue concerned, and then explore the behavioural component and its relevance to mitigating that conservation issue. Social systems, demography, life histories, habitat selection, foraging and patch choice, the Allee effect, conspecific attraction, movement, ranging and dispersal are pervasive behavioural elements common across various conservation issues that determine why some populations decline and what can be done to remedy the situation. However, the overarching principle remains the same: effective action requires an understanding of the behaviour of the species concerned. Conservation is most exciting and most difficult at two ends of a continuum: the earthiness of animal lives, human livelihoods and practical action, and the erudition of big ideas, from individual behaviours to the consequences for populations and, ultimately, geopolitical decisions about how humans are to live alongside nature with the wellbeing of both as goals.",

In animal-dispersed species, foraging behavior and movement patterns determine SDD. Direct observations of seed dispersal events by animals in natural plant populations are mostly constrained by the high mobility and low visibility of seed dispersers. Therefore, diverse alternative methods are used to estimate seed dispersal distance, but direct comparisons of these approaches within the same seed dispersal system are mostly missing. We investigated two plant species with different life history traits, Leonia cymosa and Parkia panurensis, exclusively dispersed by two tamarin species, Saguinus mystax and Leontocebus nigrifrons. We compared SDD estimates obtained from direct observations, genetic identification of mother plants from seed coats, parentage analysis of seedlings/saplings, and phenomenological and mechanistic modeling approaches. SDD derived from the different methods ranged between 158 and 201 m for P. panurensis and between 178 and 318 m for L. cymosa. In P. panurensis, the modeling approaches resulted in moderately higher estimates than observations and genotyping of seed coats. In L. cymosa, parentage analysis resulted in a lower estimate than all other methods. Overall, SDD estimates for P. panurensis (179 ± 16 m; mean ± SD) were significantly lower than for L. cymosa (266 ± 59 m; mean ± SD). Differences among methods were related to processes of the seed dispersal loop integrated by the respective methods (e.g., seed deposition or seedling distribution). We discuss the merits and limitations of each method and highlight the aspects to be considered when comparing SDD derived from different methodologies. Differences among plant species were related to differences in reproductive traits influencing gut passage time and feeding behavior, highlighting the importance of plant traits on animal-mediated seed dispersal distance.",

By applying this innovative technique to a Camellia japonica and pollinator bird system on Miyake-jima, a volcanic island of the Izu Islands, Japan, we evaluated pollen flow mediated by the pollinator Zosterops japonica under different C. japonica flower densities. These flower densities were affected by a volcanic eruption in 2000 and subsequent large emissions of volcanic gases. The genetic diversity of pollen grains adhering to pollinators in areas with low flower density was greater than in an area with high flower density. This result was consistent with bird pollinator movement elucidated by radio tracking. In areas with low flower density, resulting from volcanic activity, pollinator birds ranged over larger areas to satisfy their energy demands rather than moving to areas with higher flower density. These results indicate that the C. japonica and pollinator bird system can ensure reproductive success even though external environmental factors, such as volcanic activity, have decreased flower density.",

		"abstract": "Species - area models have become the primary tool used to predict baseline extinction rates for species in isolated habitats, and have influenced conservation and land-use planning worldwide. In particular, these models have been used to predict extinction rates following the loss or fragmentation of natural habitats in the absence of direct human influence on species persistence. Thus, where direct human influences, such as hunting, put added pressure on species in remnant habitat patches, we should expect to observe extinction rates higher than those predicted by simple species - area models. Here, we show that extinction rates for 41 species of large mammals in six nature reserves in West Africa are 14-307 times higher than those predicted by models based on reserve size alone. Human population and reserve size accounted for 98% of the observed variation in extinction rates between reserves. Extinction occurred at higher rates than predicted by species-area models for carnivores, primates and ungulates, and at the highest rates overall near reserve borders. Our results indicate that, where the harvest of wildlife is common, conservation plans should focus on increasing the size of reserves and reducing the rate of hunting.",

		"abstract": "The Minimum Area Requirements (MAR) of species is a concept that explicitly addresses area and therefore can be highly relevant for conservation planning and policy. This study compiled a comprehensive database of MAR estimates from the literature, covering 216 terrestrial animal species from 80 studies. We obtained estimates from (a) Population Viability Analyses (PVAs) which explored a range of area-related scenarios, (b) PVAs that provided a fixed value – either MAR or the minimum viable population size (MVP) alongside other area-relevant information, and (c) empirical studies of occupancy patterns in islands or isolated habitat patches across area. We assessed the explanatory power of life-history traits (body mass, feeding guild, generation length and offspring size), environmental variables (average precipitation and temperature), research approach and phylogenetic group on MAR estimates. PVAs exploring area showed strong correlation between MAR and body mass. One to two additional variables further improved the predictive power. PVA reporting fixed MAR, and occupancy-based studies, were better explained by the combination of feeding guild, climatic variables and additional life history traits. Phylogeny had a consistent but usually small contribution to the predictive power of models. Our work demonstrates that estimating the MAR across species and taxa is achievable but requires cautious interpretation. We further suggest that occupancy patterns are likely sensitive to transient dynamics and are therefore risky to use for estimating MAR. PVA-based evaluations enable considering time horizon and extinction probability, two aspects that are critical for future implementation of the MAR concept into policy and management.",

		"abstract": "Annual and seasonal home ranges were calculated for 47 Eurasian lynx in four Scandinavian study sites (two in Sweden and two in Norway). The observed home ranges were the largest reported for the species, with study site averages ranging from 600 to 1,400 km2 for resident males and from 300 to 800 km2 for resident females. When home range sizes were compared to the size of protected areas (national parks and nature reserves) in Scandinavia, it was concluded that very few protected areas contained sufficient forest to provide space for more than a few individuals. As a direct consequence of this, most lynx need to be conserved in the multiuse semi-natural forest habitats that cover large areas in Scandinavia. This conservation strategy leads to a number of conflicts with some land uses (sheep and semidomestic reindeer herding, and roe deer hunters), but not all (forestry and moose harvest). Accordingly research must be aimed at understanding the ecology of these conflicts, and finding solutions.",

		"abstract": "Conserving large carnivores in an increasingly crowded planet raises difficult challenges. A recurring debate is whether large carnivores can be conserved in human used landscapes (land sharing) or whether they require specially designated areas (land sparing). Here we show that 40% of the 170 protected areas in the global range of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) are smaller than the home range of a single adult male and only 4–13% are large enough for a 90% probability of containing 15 or more adult females. We used data from 16 snow leopards equipped with GPS collars in the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, Mongolia, to calculate home range size and overlap using three different estimators: minimum convex polygons (MCP), kernel utility distributions (Kernel), and local convex hulls (LoCoH). Local convex hull home ranges were smaller and included lower proportions of unused habitats compared to home ranges based on minimum convex polygons and Kernels. Intra-sexual home range overlap was low, especially for adult males, suggesting that snow leopards are territorial. Mean home range size based on the LoCoH estimates was 207km2±63 SD for adult males and 124km2±41 SD for adult females. Our estimates were 6–44 times larger than earlier estimates based on VHF technology when comparing similar estimators, i.e. MCP. Our study illustrates that protected areas alone will not be able to conserve predators with large home ranges and conservationists and managers should not restrict their efforts to land sparing.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the space use and movement ecology of apex predators, particularly in mosaic landscapes encompassing different land-uses, is fundamental for formulating effective conservation policy. The top extant big cat in the Middle East and the Caucasus, the Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor, has disappeared from most of its historic range. Its spatial ecology in the areas where it remains is almost unknown. Between September 2014 and May 2017, we collared and monitored six adult leopards (5 males and 1 female) using GPS-satellite Iridium transmitters in Tandoureh National Park (355 km2) along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderland. Using auto-correlated Kernel density estimation based on a continuous-time stochastic process for relocation data, we estimated a mean home range of 103.4 ± SE 51.8 km2 for resident males which is larger than has been observed in other studies of Asian leopards. Most predation events occurred in core areas, averaging 32.4 ± SE 12.7 km2. Although neighboring leopards showed high spatiotemporal overlap, their hunting areas were largely exclusive. Five out of six of leopards spent some time outside the national park, among human communities. Our study suggests that a national park can play an ‘anchoring’ role for individuals of an apex predator that spend some time in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Therefore, we envisage that instead of emphasizing either land sharing or land sparing, a combined approach can secure the viability of resilient large carnivores that are able to coexist with humans in the rugged montane landscapes of west and central Asia.",

		"abstract": "Animal tracking data are being collected more frequently, in greater detail, and on smaller taxa than ever before. These data hold the promise to increase the relevance of animal movement for understanding ecological processes, but this potential will only be fully realized if their accompanying location error is properly addressed. Historically, coarsely-sampled movement data have proved invaluable for understanding large scale processes (e.g., home range, habitat selection, etc.), but modern fine-scale data promise to unlock far more ecological information. While location error can often be ignored in coarsely sampled data, fine-scale data require much more care, and tools to do this have been lacking. Current approaches to dealing with location error largely fall into two categories--either discarding the least accurate location estimates prior to analysis or simultaneously fitting movement and error parameters in a hidden-state model. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have serious flaws. Here, we provide a general framework to account for location error in the analysis of animal tracking data, so that their potential can be unlocked. We apply our error-model-selection framework to 190 GPS, cellular, and acoustic devices representing 27 models from 14 manufacturers. Collectively, these devices are used to track a wide range of animal species comprising birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals of different sizes and with different behaviors, in urban, suburban, and wild settings. Then, using empirical data on tracked individuals from multiple species, we provide an overview of modern, error-informed movement analyses, including continuous-time path reconstruction, home-range distribution, home-range overlap, speed and distance estimation. Adding to these techniques, we introduce new error-informed estimators for outlier detection and autocorrelation visualization. We furthermore demonstrate how error-informed analyses on calibrated tracking data can be necessary to ensure that estimates are accurate and insensitive to location error, and allow researchers to use all of their data. Because error-induced biases depend on so many factors--sampling schedule, movement characteristics, tracking device, habitat, etc.--differential bias can easily confound biological inference and lead researchers to draw false conclusions.",

		"abstract": "The Wallow Fire, the largest wildfire in Arizona history, encompassed 2,170 km2 and provided a rare opportunity to examine habitat selection and home ranges of American black bears (Ursus americanus) before and after a wildfire. We had fitted global positioning system (GPS) collars on 47 bears from 2005 to April 2011, and 10 of these were still collared when the fire started in May 2011. We captured and collared an additional 7 black bears within the fire perimeter post-fire (Jul–Sep 2011 and Jun 2012). To evaluate how black bears were affected by the fire, we fit a step selection function using a conditional mixed effects Poisson regression model to estimate the relative strength of black bear habitat selection in response to burn severity. Additionally, we estimated home range sizes using an autocorrelated kernel density estimator by means of a continuous-time movement model. We then used a generalized linear model with a negative binomial error distribution and mixed effects to estimate the effect of the burn severity on black bear home range size, while controlling for sex and drought. In spring and summer in years prior to the fire, bears selected areas that later burned in the fire. After the fire, bears used all burn severities, but their selection for high-severity burns decreased significantly in summer 2011 and fall 2012. Home range sizes were 3.06 times larger pre-fire than post-fire. Our study demonstrates that black bears continued to use all burn severities after a major wildfire, and that post-fire conditions did not result in expanded black bear home ranges.",

		"abstract": "Quantifying animal movements is necessary for answering a wide array of research questions in ecology and conservation biology. Consequently, ecologists have made considerable efforts to identify the best way to estimate an animal’s home range, and many methods of estimating home ranges have arisen over the past half century. Most of these methods fall into two distinct categories of estimators that have only recently been described in statistical detail: those that measure range distributions (methods such as Kernel Density Estimation that quantify the long-run behavior of a movement process that features restricted space use) and those that measure occurrence distributions (methods such as Brownian Bridge Movement Models and the Correlated Random Walk Library that quantify uncertainty in an animal movement path during a specific period of observation). In this paper, we use theory, simulations, and empirical analysis to demonstrate the importance of applying these two classes of space use estimators appropriately and distinctly. Conflating range and occurrence distributions can have serious consequences for ecological inference and conservation practice. For example, in most situations, home-range estimates quantified using occurrence estimators are too small, and this problem is exacerbated by ongoing improvements in tracking technology that enable more frequent and more accurate data on animal movements. We encourage researchers to use range estimators to estimate the area of home ranges and occurrence estimators to answer other questions in movement ecology, such as when and where an animal crosses a linear feature, visits a location of interest, or interacts with other animals.\nOpen Research Statement Tracking data on Aepyceros melampus, Beatragus hunteri, Bycanistes bucinator, Cerdocyon thous, Eulemur rufifrons, Glyptemys insculpta, Gyps coprotheres, Madoqua guentheri, Ovis canadensis, Propithecus verreauxi, Sus scrofa, and Ursus arctos are publicly archived in the Dryad repository (Noonan et al. 2018; https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v5051j2), as are data from Procapra gutturosa (Fleming et al. 2014a; https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.45157).

		"abstract": "We deployed satellite transmitters to provide the first detailed picture of the movement behaviour of Australian Wood Ducks (Chenonetta jubata) through agricultural landscapes where the availability and spatial arrangement of resources are highly predictable. We measured movement distances and home-range areas of individual Australian Wood Ducks and investigated their site fidelity by comparing the overlap of successive home-range areas on a fortnightly temporal scale. First passage time (FPT) analysis was used to determine the spatial scales at which foraging occurs within home-range areas. We found a peak of movement activity around the periods of dawn and dusk similar to many waterfowl species. The mean overlap of core home-range areas over successive 2 week periods was 89.81% (± 2.38 SD), which demonstrates strong site fidelity. Area-restricted search (ARS) occurred at the scale of individual foraging (ca.100 m), with no clear peaks at larger spatial scales. This finding implies that search effort was expended equally across the combined utilisation distribution of Australian Wood Ducks in this agricultural landscape. Our results support the conclusions of previous studies suggesting that the movement behaviour of Australian Wood Ducks is shaped strongly by the temporal and spatial predictability of their grazing areas and access to water in the form of farm dams.",

		"abstract": "Space use by mammals can differ among age-classes, sexes, or seasons, and these processes are recognized as adaptive behavioral strategies. Semi-fossorial ground squirrels, in particular, have shown age- and sex-specific patterns in their aboveground movement behaviors. We studied space use of Mohave ground squirrels (Xerospermophilus mohavensis) at the Freeman Gulch study site in the central region of their range in the Mojave Desert, California. We documented the timing of their full annual cycle, investigated correlates of size of home ranges of adults and distance of long-distance movements by juveniles, and evaluated whether juvenile body masses and movements were related to interannual climatic variation. Adult males emerged from burrows and entered hibernation sooner than did adult females. Home ranges were larger for males (x¯ ± SD = 0.50 ± 0.40 km2) than females (0.05 ± 0.03 km2), especially during the mating season. Maximum distances moved by juveniles did not differ significantly between males (1.6 ± 2.3 km) and females (1.0 ± 1.8 km), and both sexes were equally likely to travel long distances from natal sites. The longest-distance movement we documented was 7.7 km by a juvenile male. Juveniles born in a year of low vegetation productivity gained significantly less mass (97 ± 7 g) and traveled shorter distances than those born in a year of higher vegetation productivity (177 ± 20 g). Our findings were similar to those documented in the Coso Range study site in the northern region of the geographic range of the species, indicating that movement patterns are similar range-wide. Mohave ground squirrels responded strongly to climate variation, and global climate change will likely result in a northward shift in suitable habitats. Informed conservation planning, therefore, will be essential for this rare, declining species.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the spatial context of animal movements is fundamental for the establishment and management of protected areas. We tracked, by telemetry devices, 31 captive-reared and 5 wild-rehabilitated Harpia harpyja and estimated the dispersal and space use after release in Mesoamerica. We evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas in the protection of home ranges and examined how individual traits, release methods and landscape features influenced the dispersal and home range using mixed-effects models. The mean post-release dispersal was 29.4 km (95% CI: 22.5–38.5), and the annual home ranges averaged 1039.5 km2 (95% CI: 627–1941). The home ranges were influenced by the release method, patch richness, patch and edge density and contagion. The currently protected areas in Mesoamerica may not be effective conservation units for this species. The Harpy Eagle average home range greatly exceeded the average size of 1115 terrestrial protected areas (52.7 ± 6.1 km2) in Mesoamerica. Due to their wide use of space, including transboundary space, Harpy Eagle conservation efforts may fail if they are not carefully coordinated between the countries involved. Future restoration efforts of umbrella forest-dwelling raptors should select release sites with highly aggregated and poorly interspersed forests. The release sites should have a buffer of approximately 30 km and should be located completely within protected areas.",

		"abstract": "Home range analysis is a standard and fundamental concept in ecology used to describe animal space use over their lifetimes. Connecting home range sizes with animal characteristics, location, and habitat can be used to inform conservation decisions. Reptiles are frequently lacking robust estimates of space use, particularly reptiles in tropical regions. Here we analyse a publicly available dataset, collected by the authors of this study, describing the movements of Critically Endangered Elongated Tortoises (Indotestudo elongata). The tortoise data included the locations of 17 tortoises (12 females, 5 males) collected on average once every three days for an average duration of 353.76 SE±33.10 days. We use these data to estimate the home range of Elongated Tortoise, and explore how tortoise size and sex influences home range size. To mitigate issues resulting from low effective sample sizes and low temporal resolution of the data, we used a modern home range estimation method – Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). We found 14 of 17 individuals appear to be occupying a stable home range (using variograms to determine range residency). The average AKDE home range for all 14 individuals with range residency was 44.81 ±10.44 ha. Bayesian Regression Models suggest comparable size estimates between male and female home ranges, despite males being physically larger than females in both mass and carapace length. These AKDE home range estimates have the added utility of being more comparable with other studies, less susceptible to errors from a suboptimal tracking regime, and are well positioned for inclusion in future meta-analyses.",

		"abstract": "Documenting local space use of birds that move rapidly, but are too small to carry GPS tags, such as swallows and swifts, can be challenging. For these species, tracking methods such as manual radio-telemetry and visual observation are either inadequate or labor- and time-intensive. Another option is use of an automated telemetry system, but equipment for such systems can be costly when many receivers are used. Our objective, therefore, was to determine if an automated radio-telemetry system, consisting of just two receivers, could provide an alternative to manual tracking for gathering data on local space use of six individuals of three species of aerial insectivores, including one Cliff Swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota), one Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), and four Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica). We established automated radio-telemetry systems at three sites near the city of Peterborough in eastern Ontario, Canada, from May to August 2015. We evaluated the location error of our two-receiver system using data from moving and stationary test transmitters at known locations, and used telemetry data from the aerial insectivores as a test of the system's ability to track rapidly moving birds under field conditions. Median location error was 250 m for automated telemetry test locations after filtering. More than 90% of estimated locations had large location errors and were removed from analysis, including all locations > 1 km from receiver stations. Our automated telemetry receivers recorded 17,634 detections of the six radio-tagged birds. However, filtering removed an average of 89% of bird location estimates, leaving only the Cliff Swallow with enough locations for analysis of space use. Our results demonstrate that a minimal automated radio-telemetry system can be used to assess local space use by small, highly mobile birds, but the resolution of the data collected using only two receiver stations was coarse and had a limited range. To improve both location accuracy and increase the percentage of usable location estimates collected, we suggest that, in future studies, investigators use receivers that simultaneously record signals detected by all antennas, and use of a minimum of three receiver stations with more antennas at each station.",

		"abstract": "The giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) is the largest living armadillo. This naturally rare and poorly known species is endemic to South America and classified as “Vulnerable” by the IUCN. Here we explored aspects of the spatial ecology of P. maximus in Midwestern Brazil to gain insights on its ecology and biology to support conservation efforts. In 8 years, we identified 50 individuals of P. maximus and monitored 23 of them using telemetry methods. To characterize site fidelity and home range, we fitted individual continuous-time movement models and estimated Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimates. We built a Structural Equation Model to evaluate how home-range area and daily displacement are related to each other, to sampling effort, and to individual characteristics. We estimated home-range overlap between pairs of different sexes using a bias-corrected Bhattacharyya coefficient. Finally, we formulated a canonical density estimation formula to characterize minimum population density. We gathered a total of 12,168 locations of P. maximus. The best-fitted movement models indicated site fidelity for all individuals and a median adult home-range area of 2,518 ha. Median adult daily displacement was 1,651 m. Home-range area scales positively with daily displacement and daily displacement scales positively with body mass. Median home-range overlap between pairs was low (4%) and adult females presented exclusive home ranges among themselves. Median minimum density was 7.65 individuals per 100 km2 (CI = 5.68–10.19 ind/100 km2). Our results are congruent with characterizing P. maximus as a generally asocial species, most likely promiscuous/polygynous, that establishes large, long-term home ranges, which grants the population a naturally low density. Spatial patterns and biological characteristics obtained in this study can be used to guide future conservation strategies for P. maximus in the Pantanal wetlands and elsewhere.",

The ways individuals in these complex societies respond to habitat restriction and fragmentation are unknown. We examined ranging and feeding competition in a Ruwenzori Angolan colobus MLS in a forest fragment at Nabugabo, Uganda. We analyzed GPS points collected over 2 years and scan samples collected over 10 months on 12 core units in one band to compare sex- and core unit-specific activity budgets and near-neighbor distances. The 95% home range size estimate of this band was 1.75 km2, much smaller than the ranges of similar-sized bands of primate MLS in continuous habitats. Day range length was also shorter. The colobus rarely utilized the matrix and over the two-year period core units’ home ranges overlapped by 93%. Indicators of scramble competition included more time spent feeding in larger core units, near-neighbors at greater distances when feeding relative to resting, and greater feeding for females compared to males. A quadratic relationship was found between core unit size and home range and core area size, where intermediate-sized units showed the smallest ranges. All units showed similarly tortuous paths; however, the smallest core units had the longest day range lengths and the fastest rates of travel. We conclude that while large core units suffer some food competition, small units may be displaced more in inter-unit contests because they appear to suffer the highest energetic costs searching for food within this constricted area.",

		"abstract": "Terrestrial animals feed on fruit dropped by arboreal frugivores in tropical forests around the world, but it remains unknown whether the resulting spatial associations of these animals are coincidental or intentionally maintained. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used a combination of acoustic playback experiments, remote camera monitoring, and GPS tracking to quantify the frequency of such interactions, determine who initiates and maintains spatial associations, and test whether terrestrial animals adopt a strategy of acoustic eavesdropping to locate fruit patches created by foraging primates. Indeed, 90% of fruits collected in fruit fall traps had tooth marks of arboreal frugivores, and terrestrial frugivores visited fruit trees sooner following visits by GPS-collared monkeys. While our play back experiments were insufficient to support the hypothesis that terrestrial frugivores use auditory cues to locate food dropped by arboreal primates, analyses of movement paths of capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus), spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), and coatis (Nasua narica) reveal that observed patterns of interspecific attraction are not merely a byproduct of mutual attraction to shared resources. Coatis were significantly more likely to initiate close encounters with arboreal primates than vice versa and maintained these associations by spending significantly longer periods at fruiting trees when collared primates were present. Our results demonstrate that terrestrial frugivores are attracted to arboreal primates, likely because they increase local resource availability. Primates are often among the first species in a habitat to be extirpated by hunting; our results suggest that their loss may have unanticipated consequences for the frugivore community.

		"abstract": "Species - area models have become the primary tool used to predict baseline extinction rates for species in isolated habitats, and have influenced conservation and land-use planning worldwide. In particular, these models have been used to predict extinction rates following the loss or fragmentation of natural habitats in the absence of direct human influence on species persistence. Thus, where direct human influences, such as hunting, put added pressure on species in remnant habitat patches, we should expect to observe extinction rates higher than those predicted by simple species - area models. Here, we show that extinction rates for 41 species of large mammals in six nature reserves in West Africa are 14-307 times higher than those predicted by models based on reserve size alone. Human population and reserve size accounted for 98% of the observed variation in extinction rates between reserves. Extinction occurred at higher rates than predicted by species-area models for carnivores, primates and ungulates, and at the highest rates overall near reserve borders. Our results indicate that, where the harvest of wildlife is common, conservation plans should focus on increasing the size of reserves and reducing the rate of hunting.",

		"abstract": "Large carnivores are persecuted globally because they threaten human industries and livelihoods. How this conflict is managed has consequences for the conservation of large carnivores and biodiversity more broadly. Mitigating human-predator conflict should be evidence-based and accommodate people's values while protecting carnivores. Despite much research into human and large-carnivore coexistence strategies, there have been few attempts to document the success of conflict-mitigation strategies on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of global research on conflict mitigation related to large carnivores and humans. We focused on conflicts that arise from the threat large carnivores pose to livestock. We first used structured and unstructured searching to identify replicated studies that used before-after or control-impact design to measure change in livestock loss as a result of implementing a management intervention. We then extracted relevant data from these studies to calculate an overall effect size for each intervention type. Research effort and focus varied among continents and aligned with the histories and cultures that shaped livestock production and attitudes toward carnivores. Livestock guardian animals most effectively reduced livestock losses. Lethal control was the second most effective control, although its success varied the most, and guardian animals and lethal control did not differ significantly. Financial incentives have promoted tolerance of large carnivores in some settings and reduced retaliatory killings. We suggest coexistence strategies be location-specific, incorporate cultural values and environmental conditions, and be designed such that return on financial investment can be evaluated. Improved monitoring of mitigation measures is urgently required to promote effective evidence-based policy.",

Compared to other mammalian species, primates are quite amenable to observational study; most species are diurnal and habituate quickly to the presence of human observers, allowing researchers to directly record data on their behaviors, movements, and interactions. Because, as primatologists, we can directly observe the behavior of our study animals in their natural habitats, we have never relied as heavily on telemetry (i.e., remote data collection) as scientists studying the behavior and ecology of other wild animals. Thus, before launching into specifics about how to GPS-track primates, it is worth asking why (or when) it would ever be worth the expense and the risk (to both the health of the study animal and the researcher) to catch and tag a primate with an electronic monitoring device. There are at least four distinct answers to this question.",

		"abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has become an essential tool in the Earth observation field for georeferencing, classification and accuracy assessment activities. While it was developed to be employed primarily in the open, many users nowadays operate GPS receivers in less favourable conditions. We investigated the impact of varying types and degrees of forest cover overstorey on GPS data collection, accuracy and precision. While the occurrence of canopy overhead may degrade the positional precision by one order of magnitude, it is the presence of the foliage itself (leaf-on condition) that plays a major role in the signal reception and the positional accuracy. The relationship is inverse, with increasing relative canopy closure resulting in decreasing logging efficiency and accuracy. We also found that under larger forest canopy the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) values may improve signal reception without deteriorating accuracy. Moreover, the relationship between degree of canopy closure and the accuracy RMSE follows an exponential pattern with small increases in relative canopy closure leading to huge increases in positional error. Averaging proved to be a powerful way to diminish residual positional error under forest cover, 300 fixes being proposed as a good number for GPS data acquisition under mature canopy conditions. Ultimately, we judged that PDOP is not as good an indicator for positional accuracy under forest canopy as is universally acclaimed.",

		"abstract": "Automated tracking using a satellite global position system (GPS) has major potential as a research tool in studies of primate ecology. However, implementation has been limited, at least partly because of technological difficulties associated with the dense forest habitat of many primates. In contrast, primates inhabiting relatively open environments may provide ideal subjects for use of GPS collars, yet no empirical tests have evaluated this proposition. Here, we used an automated GPS collar to record the locations, approximate body surface temperature, and activity for an adult female baboon during 90 days in the savannah habitat of Amboseli, Kenya. Given the GPS collar's impressive reliability, high spatial accuracy, other associated measurements, and low impact on the study animal, our results indicate the great potential of applying GPS technology to research on wild primates.

Although it was difficult to estimate home range sizes, minimum reliably estimated home range sizes for adult females are ca. 850 ha, whereas subadult and adult males used ranges of at least ca. 2500 ha, and perhaps much more. Range overlap was very high: up to 16 adult females, 9 adult males and at least 15 subadult males were seen within a single 4-ha square in the center of the study area. We found no evidence for the use of seasonally distincthome ranges—commuters—, and only some subadult males may have been transients—wanderers—without a stable home range. The large size of the home ranges is attributed to the coarse grain of the habitat mosaic, with orangutans converging on parts with a high density of favored fruit trees. Orangutans at this swamp forest included a variety of habitat types within their ranges.",

By combining such data with information on foraging and ranging behavior of nonhuman primates, one can analyze the influence of resource distribution on social organization and group cohesion. We investigated the abilities of a three-channel GPS receiver to collect location data under varying canopy densities in both temperate and tropical forests. Eighty randomly selected points were sampled in a beech–maple forest in northeast Ohio, USA; 65 points also were sampled at several tropical forests in Costa Rica and Trinidad. At each point we attempted to obtain a GPS position fix; we also determined the speed of satellite acquisition and measured canopy density using a spherical densiometer. The ability to obtain a reading differed greatly between the two forest types (χ2 = 53.79, P < 0.001). Ninety-seven percent of all attempts were successful in the temperate forest, whereas only a 34% acquisition rate was obtained in the tropical forests. Logistic regression showed that the probability of obtaining a reading in Neotropical forests was 75% but only when canopy cover was less than 20%. Thus, these minimal-channel GPS units may be of limited utility for behavioral ecologists working in closed-canopy Neotropical forests. Am. J. Primatol. 46:167–172, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT Since the completion of the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) in 1995, the integration of GPS and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology has expanded to a great number of ecological and conservation applications. In tropical rain forest ecology, however, the technology has remained relatively neglected, despite its great potential. Notwithstanding cost, this is principally due to (1) the difficulty of quality satellite reception beneath a dense forest canopy, and (2) a degree of spatial error unacceptable to fine-scale vegetation mapping. Here, we report on the technical use of GPS/GIS in the rain forest of Kibale National Park, Uganda, and the methodology necessary to acquire high-accuracy spatial measurements. We conclude that the stringent operating parameters necessary for high accuracy were rarely obtained while standing beneath the rain forest canopy. Raising the GPS antenna to heights of 25–30 m resolved this problem, allowing swift data collection on the spatial dispersion of individual rain forest trees. We discuss the impact of the 1996 Presidential Decision Directive that suspended U.S. military-induced GPS error on 1 May 2000, and comment on the potential applications of GPS/GIS technology to the ecological study and conservation of tropical rain forests.",

		"abstract": "In territorial species, the distribution of neighbours and food abundance play a crucial role in space use patterns but less is known about how and when neighbours use shared areas in non-territorial species. We investigated space partitioning in 10 groups of wild, non-territorial mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). Using location data, we examined factors influencing daily movement decisions and calculated the per cent overlap of annual kernel home ranges and core areas among neighbours. We found that the probability that a group chose an area was positively influenced by both food availability and the previous use of that area by the group. Additionally, groups reduced their overall utilization of areas previously used by neighbouring groups. Lastly, groups used their core areas more exclusively than their home ranges. In sum, our results show that both foraging needs and avoidance of competition with neighbours determined the gorillas' daily movement decisions, which presumably lead to largely mutually exclusive core areas. Our research suggests that non-territorial species actively avoid neighbours to maintain core area exclusivity. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of the costs and benefits of non-territoriality.",

		"abstract": "Resource selection functions are among the most commonly used statistical tools in both basic and applied animal ecology. They are typically parameterized using animal tracking data, and advances in animal tracking technology have led to increasing levels of autocorrelation between locations in such data sets. Because resource selection functions assume that data are independent and identically distributed, such autocorrelation can cause misleadingly narrow confidence intervals and biased parameter estimates. Data thinning, generalized estimating equations, and step selection functions have been suggested as techniques for mitigating the statistical problems posed by autocorrelation, but these approaches have notable limitations that include statistical inefficiency, unclear or arbitrary targets for adequate levels of statistical independence, constraints in input data, and (in the case of step selection functions) scale-dependent inference. To remedy these problems, we introduce a method for likelihood weighting of animal locations to mitigate the negative consequences of autocorrelation on resource selection functions. This method weights each observed location in an animal’s movement track according to its level of autocorrelation, expanding confidence intervals to match an objective target (i.e., the effective sample size for Autocorrelated Gaussian Density Estimation) and accounting for bias that can arise when there are gaps in the movement track. In this study, we describe the mathematical principles underlying our method, demonstrate its practical advantages versus conventional approaches using simulations and empirical data on a water mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), a caracal (Caracal caracal), and a serval (Leptailurus serval), and discuss pathways for further development of our method. We also provide a complete, annotated analytical workflow to help new users apply our method to their own animal tracking data using the ctmm R package.",

		"abstract": "Researchers of “culture” have long been interested in the role of social learning in establishing patterns of behavioral variation in wild animals, but very few studies examine this issue using a developmental approach. This 7-year study examines the acquisition of techniques used to process Luehea candida fruits in a wild population of white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus, residing in and near Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica. The two techniques for extracting seeds (pounding or scrubbing) were approximately equal in efficiency, and subjects experimented with both techniques before settling on one technique—typically the one they most frequently observed. In a sample of 106 subjects that had already settled on a preferred technique, the females adopted the maternal technique significantly more often than expected by chance, but the males did not. Using a longitudinal approach, I examined the acquisition of Luehea processing techniques during the first 5 years of life. Regression analysis revealed that the technique most frequently observed (measured as proportion of Luehea processing bouts observed that used pounding as opposed to scrubbing) significantly predicted the technique adopted by female observers, particularly in the second year of life; the amount of impact of the observed technique on the practiced technique was somewhat less significant for male observers. These results held true for (a) observations of maternal technique only, (b) observations of technique used by all individuals other than the mother, and (c) observations of maternal and non-maternal techniques combined.",

To promote a more dynamic approach, we show how areas of particular interest in terms of exploitation intensity (mean residence time per visit) or in terms of path recursions (visit frequency) can easily be identified by combining and extending two procedures that were initially published to compute the residence time on the one hand and the movement-based UD on the other hand. Identifying the areas of a home range that are intensively exploited and/or repeatedly visited opens interesting perspectives in the study of the processes by which home range owners adapt their movement behavior to the dynamics of the resources they feed on.",

The locations of the profitable places actually used, which may be only a subset of the whole set of suitable areas available, are usually unknown, but can be inferred from movement analysis by assuming that these places correspond to the limited areas where the animals spend more time than elsewhere. Identifying these intensively used areas makes it possible, through subsequent analyses, to address both how they are distributed with respect to key habitat features, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically reviewed the few previously published methods to detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur when an animal enters a profitable place. As all of them appeared to be too narrowly tuned to specific situations, we designed a new, easy-to-use method based on the time spent in the vicinity of successive path locations. We used computer simulations to show that our method is both quite general and robust to noisy data.",

		"abstract": "Home ranges (HRs) are a remarkably common form of animal space use, but we still lack an integrated view of the individual-level processes that can lead to their emergence and maintenance, particularly when individuals are in competition for resources. We built a spatially explicit mechanistic movement model to investigate how simple memory-based foraging rules may enable animals to establish HRs and to what extent this increases their foraging efficiency compared to individuals that do not base foraging decisions on memory. We showed that these simple rules enable individuals to perform better than individuals using the most efficient strategy that does not rely on memory and drive them to spatially segregate through avoidance of resource patches used by others. This striking result questions the common assumption that low HR overlaps are indicators of territorial behavior. Indeed, it appears that, by using an information-updating system, individuals can keep their environment relatively predictable without paying the cost of defending an exclusive space. However, memory-based foraging strategies leading to HR emergence seem unable to prevent the disruptive effects of the arrival of new individuals. This calls for further research on the mechanisms that can stabilize HR spatial organization in the long term.",

		"abstract": "Movement plays a role in structuring the interactions between individuals, their environment, and other species. Although movement models coupled with empirical data are widely used to study animal distribution, they have seldom been used to study search time. This paper proposes first passage time as a novel approach for understanding the effect of the landscape on animal movement and search time. In the context of animal movement, first passage time is the time taken for an animal to reach a specified site for the first time. We synthesize current first passage time theory and derive a general first passage time equation for animal movement. This equation is related to the Fokker–Planck equation, which is used to describe the distribution of animals in the landscape. We illustrate the first passage time method by analyzing the effect of territorial behavior on the time required for a red fox to locate prey throughout its home range. Using first passage time to compute search times, we consider the effect of two different searching modes on a functional response. We show that random searching leads to a Holling type III functional response. First passage time analysis provides a new tool for studying how animal movement may influence ecological processes.",

		"abstract": "Projects focused on movement behavior and home range are commonplace, but beyond a focus on choosing appropriate research questions, there are no clear guidelines for such studies. The estimation of space-use and movement properties is often necessary to answer basic movement ecology questions, but designing an animal tracking study to produce reliable estimates is often done in an ad hoc manner. We developed 'movedesign', a user-friendly Shiny application, which can be utilized to investigate the precision of three estimates regularly reported in movement and spatial ecology studies: home range area, speed, and distance traveled. Conceptually similar to statistical power analysis, this application enables users to assess the degree of estimate precision that may be achieved with a given sampling design. Leveraging the 'ctmm' R package, we utilize two methods proven to handle many common biases in animal movement datasets: autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE) and continuous-time speed and distance (CTSD) estimators. Longer sampling durations are required to reliably estimate home range areas via the detection of a sufficient number of home range crossings. In contrast, speed and distance estimation requires a sampling interval short enough to ensure that a statistically significant signature of the animal's velocity remains in the data. This application addresses key challenges faced by researchers when designing tracking studies, including the trade-off between long battery life and high resolution of GPS devices, which may result in a compromise between reliably estimating home range or speed and distance. 'movedesign' has broad applications for researchers and decision-makers, supporting them to focus efforts and resources in achieving the optimal sampling design strategy for their research questions, prioritizing the correct deployment decisions for insightful and reliable outputs, while understanding the trade-off associated with these choices.",

		"abstract": "Many large animal species have a high risk of extinction. This is usually thought to result simply from the way that species traits associated with vulnerability, such as low reproductive rates, scale with body size. In a broad-scale analysis of extinction risk in mammals, we find two additional patterns in the size selectivity of extinction risk. First, impacts of both intrinsic and environmental factors increase sharply above a threshold body mass around 3 kilograms. Second, whereas extinction risk in smaller species is driven by environmental factors, in larger species it is driven by a combination of environmental factors and intrinsic traits. Thus, the disadvantages of large size are greater than generally recognized, and future loss of large mammal biodiversity could be far more rapid than expected.",

We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact.

		"abstract": "Habitat disturbance is disrupting ecological processes globally. The Atlantic Forest is particularly affected by land-use intensification and defaunation, where primates play a key role in seed dispersal. Here, we evaluate how primate assemblages in the Atlantic Forest change according to landscape modification and the ecological consequences on seed dispersal. For this, we used 38 primate assemblages in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. We assessed the effects of patch size, mean inter-patch distance, functional connectivity and matrix permeability on primate species richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion, distinguishing response traits (sensitivity to habitat disturbance) from effect traits (effect on seed dispersal). We further investigated which primate functional response–effect traits were retained in forest patches of different sizes. Increased inter-patch distance reduced primate species richness. Decreased patch size led to a more uneven and less divergent distribution of response trait values within the functional space indicating the filtering of primates with similar strategies to cope with habitat loss. However, the increased divergence of effect traits in smaller patches indicates that those primates present distinct traits as seed dispersers. Finally, less permeable landscapes retained an uneven distribution of primate effect traits. Our findings indicate that reduced patch size results in primates with similar response traits, living in small groups and travelling short distances daily, but with contrasting traits as seed dispersers, which is positive for the persistence of non-redundant services in disturbed landscapes. However, the reduced species richness in such isolated patches and the resistance to movement among them may compromise the long-term viability of primate ecosystem services. Therefore, we encourage that further conservation planning should increase landscape connectivity, ensure the effective protection of native forests and increase anthropogenic matrix quality to develop biodiversity-friendly landscapes that protect not only species but also the ecosystem services they provide.",

		"abstract": "A growing number of studies quantify the impact of nonlethal human disturbance on the behavior and reproductive success of animals. Athough many are well designed and analytically sophisticated, most lack a theoretical framework for making predictions and for understanding why particular responses occur. Behavioral ecologists have recently begun to fill this theoretical vacuum by applying economic models of antipredator behavior to disturbance studies. In this emerging paradigm, predation and nonlethal disturbance stimuli create similar trade-offs between avoiding perceived risk and other fitness-enhancing activities, such as feeding, parental care, or mating. A vast literature supports the hypothesis that antipredator behavior has a cost to other activities, and that this trade-off is optimized when investment in antipredator behavior tracks short-term changes in predation risk. Prey have evolved antipredator responses to generalized threatening stimuli, such as loud noises and rapidly approaching objects. Thus, when encountering disturbance stimuli ranging from the dramatic, lowflying helicopter to the quiet wildlife photographer, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey encountering predators. Some authors have argued that, similar to predation risk, disturbance stimuli can indirectly affect fitness and population dynamics via the energetic and lost opportunity costs of risk avoidance. We elaborate on this argument by discussing why, from an evolutionary perspective, disturbance stimuli should be analogous to predation risk. We then consider disturbance effects on the behavior of individuals--vigilance, fleeing, habitat selection, mating displays, and parental investment--as well as indirect effects on populations and communities. A wider application of predation risk theory to disturbance studies should increase the generality of predictions and make mitigation more effective without over-regulating human activities.",

		"abstract": "The critically endangered white-headed langur (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) is confined to fragmented karst forests of southwest Guangxi Province, China. A lack of information on the influence of habitat fragmentation on langur behavior has prevented a comprehensive understanding of their ranging behavior and the development of effective langur conservation strategies. We collected comparative data on time budgets, daily path lengths, home range and diets of four langur groups inhabiting the lightly fragmented Fusui forest (G1, G2) and the more heavily fragmented Chongzuo forest (G3, G4). The aim was to explore the effect of this fragmentation on langur ranging behavior. Our results showed that the Fusui groups spent more time on moving and less time on feeding and playing than the Chongzuo groups. Daily path lengths were 472.4–536.1 m for the Fusui groups and 449.6–480.7 m for the Chongzuo groups, indicating no marked inter-site variation. The Fusui groups occupied much larger home ranges (23.8–33.8 ha) than the Chongzuo groups (14.5–15.8 ha). However, all groups had similar monthly home ranges. Diets significantly differed among langur groups. The Fusui groups consumed more young leaves and had much lower diet diversity compared with the Chongzuo groups. Our findings indicate that habitat fragmentation is one of the crucial determinants of white-headed langur ranging behavior because fragmentation reduces and restricts the home range. Langurs in fragmented habitat adopt an energy conservation strategy characterized by devoting more time to feeding and less time to moving, with a smaller home range and consumption of more plant species. We argue that linking fragmented forests with corridors should be considered a priority in a wider and comprehensive longer term langur population conservation and habitat management strategy.",

		"abstract": "The development of roads and associated infrastructure has interrupted several traditional migrations of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Norway. The population in the Setesdal Austhei wild reindeer area still migrates from winter to calving grounds by semi-annually crossing a cabin-lined road through a narrow corridor, in which further anthropogenic development is planned. To understand if and how infrastructure affected reindeer migration patterns we studied the movements of 10 female reindeer equipped with GPS collars between 2002 and 2010. First, we identified the start and end of the migration period, and then we compared trajectory parameters (net displacement, step length and turning angles) recorded during migration with those recorded in proximity of the road. The analysis of the net displacement indicated that during spring migration reindeer moved at a constant pace towards the calving ground covering a net linear distance of 25 km in 40 days. In the middle of migration, reindeer changed travel direction and roamed parallel to the road for ca. 5 days without approaching further, possibly searching for an undisturbed place and time to cross. Reindeer finally crossed the road before daylight with highly directed movements, increasing their travel speed up to the highest values recorded during migration (4 km/3 hrs vs. 0.5 km/3 hrs). After crossing, reindeer moved quickly toward their calving ground covering the remaining 25 km net distance in less than a week. Migration patterns were markedly affected by disturbance during spring, as the road crossings occurred in the period characterized by the high traffic volume and intense human activities related to Easter holidays; during autumn, on the contrary, the hampering effect of the road was minimal. The results suggest that the current disturbance associated to the road hampers spring migration and might delay the arrival to the calving ground. The planned construction of a large number of recreational cabins in the migration corridor has the potential to threaten the migration and obstruct the access to the calving ground.",

		"abstract": "Crested Tit Parus cristatus young from first broods dispersed 1 week later if they were born in small isolated pine plots (‘habitat fragments’) compared with individuals in a large pine forest (‘continuous habitat’). This delay in dispersal was caused by an extended period between fledging and dispersal. In second broods, the delay was even longer due to the interbrood interval being 9 days longer in habitat fragments. As nestlings in habitat fragments had a lower body-mass, and age at dispersal was negatively correlated with nestling body-mass within each nest, the postponed dispersal from fragments might be explained partly by a lower body-mass. Alternatively, postponed dispersal from fragments could result from a barrier effect caused by reluctance to cross inhospitable habitat. Immigration by young from first broods into habitat fragments was delayed by approximately 3 weeks, and proportionally more second brood emigrants were recovered in this type of habitat. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that fragments are second-choice habitat. Early immigrants into continuous habitat had a higher probability of settlement in winter flocks compared with late ones, independent of condition or age. Therefore, Crested Tits born in habitat fragments probably have a lower chance of settling in first-choice habitat.",

		"abstract": "In most metapopulation models dispersal is assumed to be a fixed species-specific trait, but in reality dispersal abilities are highly sensitive to various selective pressures. Strict isolation of a metapopulation, which precludes any influx of immigrants (and their genes) from outside and makes it impossible for emigrants to reach other localities with suitable habitat, thus reducing fitness benefits of long-distance dispersal to zero, may be expected to impose strong selection against dispersal. We tested the above prediction by comparing dispersal parameters derived with the Virtual Migration model for isolated and non-isolated metapopulations of two species of large blue Maculinea (= Phengaris) butterflies, surveyed with intensive mark-recapture. Mortality during dispersal was found to be twice (in M. teleius) to five times higher (in M. arion) in isolated metapopulations. Isolation also resulted in significantly reduced dispersal distances in isolated metapopulations, with the effect being particularly strong in M. arion females. Apart from its evolutionary and ecological consequences, dispersal depression in isolated butterfly metapopulations implied by our results has serious conservation implications. It provides a clear argument against using parameter values obtained in a different environmental setting in modelling applications, e.g., Population Viability Analyses or environmental impact assessment. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of establishing well-connected networks of suitable habitats prior to species release in areas where reintroductions are planned.",

		"abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is expected to impose strong selective pressures on dispersal rates. However, evolutionary responses of dispersal are not self-evident, since various selection pressures act in opposite directions. Here we disentangled the components of dispersal behavior in a metapopulation context using the Virtual Migration model, and we linked their variation to habitat fragmentation in the specialist butterfly Proclossiana eunomia. Our study provided a nearly unique opportunity to study how habitat fragmentation modifies dispersal at the landscape scale, as opposed to microlandscapes or simulation studies. Indeed, we studied the same species in four landscapes with various habitat fragmentation levels, in which large amounts of field data were collected and analyzed using similar methodologies. We showed the existence of quantitative variations in dispersal behavior correlated with increased fragmentation. Dispersal propensity from habitat patches (for a given patch size), and mortality during dispersal (for a given patch connectivity) were lower in more fragmented landscapes. We suggest that these were the consequences of two different evolutionary responses of dispersal behavior at the individual level: (1) when fragmentation increased, the reluctance of individuals to cross habitat patch boundaries also increased; (2) when individuals dispersed, they flew straighter in the matrix, which is the best strategy to improve dispersal success. Such evolutionary responses could generate complex nonlinear patterns of dispersal changes at the metapopulation level according to habitat fragmentation. Due to the small size and increased isolation of habitat patches in fragmented landscapes, overall emigration rate and mortality during dispersal remained high. As a consequence, successful dispersal at the metapopulation scale remained limited. Therefore, to what extent the selection of individuals with a lower dispersal propensity and a higher survival during dispersal is able to limit detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal success is unknown, and any conclusion that metapopulations would compensate for them is flawed.",

		"abstract": "Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Lévy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Lévy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain Lévy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Lévy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Lévy walks. This model shows that Lévy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing Lévy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.",

After 6 yr of observation of a group of gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena johnstonii) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we observed exploration of a new area, followed 7 mo later by a group split. We recorded their ranging and foraging behavior for 22 mo after the first exploration. Controlling for weather variables, we found that mangabeys moved longer daily travel distances, explored more area per day, and had larger group spreads in the new area compared to the old area in both parent and daughter groups. The increase in search swath in the new area likely enabled the monkeys to counteract their lack of knowledge of food locations in the new area, as the efficiency in finding fruit in general did not differ between the old and new areas. We did, however, find a lower efficiency in finding fruit from preferred fig trees whose edibility could not be assessed by visual cues in the new area. Fig finding efficiency remained lower, even when we controlled for potential differences in fig density. In addition, mangabeys traveled and foraged less often on the ground in the new compared to the old area. However, when the monkeys became more familiar with the new area, terrestrial behavior increased. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that when monkeys move into an area in which they have no experience, an absence of knowledge acquired via long-term spatial memory decreases their foraging efficiency.",

		"abstract": "Understanding how niche differences evolve in ecologically similar species and how these differences are maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. We studied resource partitioning and niche overlap between the hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock) and other frugivorous vertebrates from April 2016 to January 2018 in Satchari National Park, Sylhet, Bangladesh. We examined the differences in their diet, niche breadth, niche overlap, and characterization of patch use. We recorded feeding events of gibbons and other frugivorous vertebrates using ad libitum sampling. Gibbons consumed 76 plant species including 32 non-fig fruits and 14 figs. Twenty-one competing frugivorous vertebrate species shared 10–70% of their food species with hoolocks. Competition for fruits was intense among gibbons, macaques, and hornbills, as fruits comprised more than 50% of their diet. The niche breadth of the gibbons varied across seasons. It was lowest during the rainy season (BA = 0.39) when fruits were more readily available, and highest in winter (BA = 0.58) when gibbons were less selective due to food scarcity. The niche overlap was highest between gibbons and northern pig-tailed macaques (Ojk = 0.70), followed by gibbons and hornbills (Ojk = 0.68). Feeding heights and substrate used varied significantly between gibbons and competitors. Gibbons may minimize competition by specializing on various food resources and using different forest patches.",

		"abstract": "1.Existing theory suggests that territoriality will evolve when resources are limited and defendable, but defendability has seldom been analyzed quantitatively.2.Here we argue that defendability depends on the ability of an animal to monitor the boundaries of its range in order to detect potential intruders and introduce an index of defendability (D) which is the ratio of observed daily path length (d) to an area equal to the diameter (d′) of a circle with area equal to home range area of the animal. This index is sensitive only to extreme deviation from circular shape.3.Review of the literature on primate ranging reveals that all territorial groups for which data are available have an index of 1.0 or greater, and that few nonterritorial species have an index of 1.0 or greater.4.Regression analysis of the relationship of daily path length to feeding group weight and foliage in the diet reveals that both feeding group weight and foliage in the diet account for a large proportion of the variance in daily path length, and that territorial and nonterritorial groups do not differ in day range for a given group weight and diet.",

		"abstract": "Resource selection functions (RSFs) are among the most commonly used statistical tools in both basic and applied animal ecology. They are typically parameterized using animal tracking data, and advances in animal tracking technology have led to increasing levels of autocorrelation between locations in such data sets. Because RSFs assume that data are independent and identically distributed, such autocorrelation can cause misleadingly narrow confidence intervals and biased parameter estimates. Data thinning, generalized estimating equations and step selection functions (SSFs) have been suggested as techniques for mitigating the statistical problems posed by autocorrelation, but these approaches have notable limitations that include statistical inefficiency, unclear or arbitrary targets for adequate levels of statistical independence, constraints in input data and (in the case of SSFs) scale-dependent inference. To remedy these problems, we introduce a method for likelihood weighting of animal locations to mitigate the negative consequences of autocorrelation on RSFs. In this study, we demonstrate that this method weights each observed location in an animal's movement track according to its level of non-independence, expanding confidence intervals and reducing bias that can arise when there are missing data in the movement track. Ecologists and conservation biologists can use this method to improve the quality of inferences derived from RSFs. We also provide a complete, annotated analytical workflow to help new users apply our method to their own animal tracking data using the ctmm R package.",

		"abstract": "1. Despite the routine nature of studying home-range (HR) overlap, a formal inferential framework for overlap analyses has only recently emerged. This framework allows for the computation of approximate confidence intervals (CIs) for the Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC), a pairwise overlap metric with a formal basis in distributional similarity. However, prior comparisons of common overlap metrics suggest that the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI) is preferred over the BC for analyses of HR overlap in which a measure of space sharing is desired, rather than pure distributional similarity. 2. An inferential framework for the UDOI is facilitated by a recent advancement in HR estimation called autocorrelated KDE (AKDE). AKDE explicitly accounts for autocorrelation in tracking data via the fitting of an autocorrelated movement model; uncertainty in fitted model parameters is then leveraged to obtain the uncertainty for estimates of both HR area and overlap. The UDOI is the product of two components: the average probability of encounter (APE) and the area of overlap, A1,2. Thus, we expand the existing inferential framework for the BC to include an estimator and CIs for the UDOI via developing estimators and CIs for its two components. In particular, AKDE error propagation is used to obtain CIs on the APE, while a geometric estimator is employed for estimating A1,2 and its uncertainty. 3. We use simulated data exhibiting varying degrees of overlap to demonstrate that our estimators provide accurate estimates of true overlap values and our CIs provide reasonable coverage. Furthermore, an empirical case study is presented to illustrate the differential purposes of the BC and UDOI, highlighting the importance of choosing an overlap metric based on the analysis objective. 4. By expanding the existing inferential framework for overlap to include the UDOI, we provide ecological researchers with more flexibility to choose an overlap metric that is tailored to their objectives. This allows for more accurate conclusions to be drawn from HR overlap analyses when a measure of space sharing is desired. This method is available in conjunction with the open-source R package ctmm, using modified overlap functions that are now freely available.",

		"abstract": "Sex-biased dispersal can reduce kin cooperation and kin competition in the dispersed sex. However, this may not be the case when group-living animals engage in parallel dispersal, which occurs when an individual transfers between groups together with other animals or immigrates alone into a group that contains familiar animals. Despite this potential effect on kin cooperation and competition, few studies have thoroughly investigated how parallel dispersal affects the kin composition of groups. To further our understanding of this topic, we investigated the effect of parallel dispersal on access to coresident kin in male white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. Between 2006 and 2013, we collected demographic and genetic data from two to five groups in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. We genotyped 41 females and 39 males at 14 short tandem repeat loci, and we calculated their estimated relatedness values. The majority of males dispersed in parallel, and parallel dispersing males were more closely related to one another than were other males. Parallel immigrant males and natal females resided with a similar number of same-sex kin. Single immigrant males in multimale groups rarely resided with male kin, and they resided with fewer same-sex kin than did parallel immigrant males and natal females. Because parallel dispersal offers an opportunity for males to form long-lasting cooperative relationships with familiar kin, this dispersal pattern should be taken into account in future models of the evolution of social structure.",

		"abstract": "Tropical dry forests are among the world’s most imperiled biomes, and most long-lived and large-bodied animals that inhabit tropical dry forests persist in small, fragmented populations. Long-term monitoring is necessary for understanding the extent to which such populations can cope with changing climate conditions and recover after the elimination of human disturbances. We investigated how conservation measures, local rainfall patterns, and large-scale climate oscillations have affected the population dynamics of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in a Costa Rican tropical dry forest over a 42-year period after the elimination of most human disturbances. The population’s rapid initial growth and later stabilization suggests that it was below the habitat’s carrying capacity at the time of the conservation area’s establishment. Management practices, such as aggressive fire suppression, may have played an important role in promoting this growth. Rainfall patterns were strongly coupled with phases and intensity conditions of the El Niño Southern Oscillation. The population experienced two distinct growth phases after the conservation area’s establishment, a period of rapid growth through the 1980s and 1990s and a subsequent period of stability from about 2000 to the present. El Niño-like conditions in the three years preceding a census year were associated with declines in reproductive output and/or offspring mortality during the rapid growth phase. The sensitivity of this ecosystem to global climatic phenomena suggests that some animals will be negatively affected if drought years become more common as the global climate warms.",

We analysed infant mortality in relation to drought in two primate species (white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus imitator, and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi) in a tropical dry forest in northwestern Costa Rica. Our survival analyses combine several rare and valuable long-term datasets, including long-term primate life-history, landscape-scale fruit abundance, food-tree mortality, and climate conditions. Infant capuchins showed a threshold mortality response to drought, with exceptionally high mortality during a period of intense drought, but not during periods of moderate water shortage. By contrast, spider monkey females stopped reproducing during severe drought, and the mortality of infant spider monkeys peaked later during a period of low fruit abundance and high food-tree mortality linked to the drought. These divergent patterns implicate differing physiology, behaviour or associated factors in shaping species-specific drought responses. Our findings link predictions about the Earth's changing climate to environmental influences on primate mortality risk and thereby improve our understanding of how the increasing severity and frequency of droughts will affect the dynamics and conservation of wild primates.",

		"abstract": "Although males often disperse to increase their immediate access to mates, it is unclear whether they also consider potential future reproductive opportunities. We investigated whether immediate or delayed reproductive opportunities predicted dispersal decisions and reproductive success of subordinate immigrant male white-faced capuchins in the Sector Santa Rosa, the Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We collected genetic, behavioral, and demographic data from four social groups across 20 years. We genotyped individuals at up to 20 short tandem repeat loci to determine paternity. Having previously sired offspring in a group did not predict the subordinate immigrant male’s likelihood of staying or dispersing. Instead, a male was more likely to remain in the group if he was younger and likely to benefit from queuing for future reproductive opportunities. Subordinate immigrant males were more likely to sire offspring if they resided with a long-term alpha male and his mature daughters, who avoid inbreeding. Reproductive output was similar among three categories of males: those that became alpha immediately after immigration, those that became alpha after queuing, and subordinate males that resided with a long-term alpha male and his mature daughters. These three categories of males had higher reproductive success than subordinates who did not reside with mature daughters of the alpha male. Waiting for reproductive opportunities can lead to high reproductive success and could be important in maintaining tolerant or cooperative male-male relationships in species with high reproductive skew, long alpha male tenures, and intense between-group mating competition requiring cooperative male group defense.",

		"abstract": "Long-term male–female bonds and bi-parental investment in offspring are hallmarks of human society. A key question is how these traits evolved from the polygynandrously mating multimale multifemale society that likely characterized the Pan-Homo ancestor. In all three species of savanna baboons, lactating females form strong ties (sometimes called “friendships”) with one or more adult males. For yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), several lines of evidence suggest that these relationships are a form of male parenting effort. In olive baboons (Papio anubis), females are thought to preferentially mate with their “friends”, and male-female bonds may thus function as a form of mating effort. Here, we draw on behavioral and genetic data to evaluate the factors that shape male-female relationships in a well-studied population of olive baboons. We find support for the parenting effort hypothesis in that sires have stronger bonds with their infants' mothers than do other males. These bonds sometimes persist past weaning age and, in many cases, the sire of the previous infant is still a close partner of the female when she nurses her subsequent offspring. We find that males who have the strongest bonds with females that have resumed cycling, but are not currently sexually receptive, are more likely to sire the female's next offspring but the estimate is associated with large statistical uncertainty. We also find that in over one third of the cases, a female's successive infants were sired by the same male. Thus, in olive baboons, the development of stable breeding bonds and paternal investment seem to be grounded in the formation of close ties between males and anestrous females. However, other factors such as male dominance rank also influence paternity success and may preclude stability of these bonds to the extent found in human societies.",

In long-lived species, like primates, lifespan is one of the main components of fitness. We used 18 years of data from the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project to quantify social integration in 11 capuchin (Cebus capucinus) groups and tested whether female survivorship was associated with females’ tendencies to interact with three types of partners: (1) all group members, (2) adult females, and (3) adult males. We found strong evidence that females who engaged more with other females in affiliative interactions and foraged in close proximity experienced increased survivorship. We found some weak evidence that females might also benefit from engaging in more support in agonistic contexts with other females. These benefits were evident in models that account for the females’ rank and group size. Female interactions with all group members also increased survival, but the estimates of the effects were more uncertain. In interactions with adult males, only females who provided more grooming to males survived longer. The results presented here suggest that social integration may result in survival-related benefits. Females might enjoy these benefits through exchanging grooming for other currencies, such as coalitionary support or tolerance.",

The present research observes transfers of meat over a yearlong period among 25 households of indigenous Mayangna and Miskito horticulturalists in Nicaragua. To analyze these data, we extend the multilevel formulation of the social relations model to count data, namely the number of portions of meat exchanged between households. Along with other covariates, we examine the effect of an “association index,” which reflects the amount of time that households interact with one another. The association index exhibits a positive effect on sharing, and our overall results indicate that food sharing networks largely correspond to kin-based networks of social interaction, suggesting that food sharing is embedded in broader social relationships between households. We discuss possible extensions of our methodological approach, as appropriate for research on food sharing and social network analysis more broadly.",

		"abstract": "Multilevel modeling (MLM) is a method for analyzing hierarchically nested data structures such as over-time data from individuals (i.e., observations are nested within individuals) or group data (i.e., individuals are nested within groups). In this chapter we consider multilevel analyses for dyadic data. Dyads are a special case of groups in that the number of individuals nested within each group equals two. From a multilevel perspective, this small group size represents a potential difficulty because, with only two data points, the two-step analysis conceptualization does not work. That is, if there are only two data points, it is not possible to compute a lower-level regression for each dyad because any two data points fall exactly on a line. Nonetheless, as we discuss in this chapter, MLM represents a powerful tool for the analysis of dyadic data, both for simple dyadic designs in which each person is a member of only one dyad as well as for complex designs in which individuals may participate in more than one dyad. Dyadic data are very common in the social and behavioral sciences. The prototypical dyad study involves heterosexual married couples. However, there are many other possibilities. We begin with key definitions in dyadic analysis concerning types of dyads, types of dyadic designs, and types of variables. We then consider the use of MLM for the three major types of dyadic designs. Finally, we consider the analysis of over-time data for one of those designs. Most dyadic researchers would benefit from reading the entire chapter even if they have an interest in only one of these designs. Topics that are discussed in one section (e.g., coding of variables, computer syntax, and interpretation of results) are relevant for the other sections of the chapter. Because we cover many topics, we are limited in the amount of space that can be dedicated to illustrations; however, we have included example data sets, syntax files, and outputs on the website for the book. Here we focus primarily on the syntax of computer applications, but space limitations preclude discussion of all programs, and so we present syntax for use with SAS software. We chose SAS because of its flexibility and its ability to link to data transformations and other procedures. However, at times we discuss the use of SPSS and other programs. To help interpret the syntax, we adopt the convention that syntax commands are denoted by upper-case terms whereas variable names are denoted by lower-case terms in bold. We presume that the reader already has some familiarity with the concepts of MLM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)",

		"abstract": "Little published information exists detailing home range changes among nonhuman primates. Resulting from human destruction of the habitat, one of the observed Nilgiri langur troops was forced to relocate its home range, during which several interesting behavioral patterns emerged. Most important was the observation that the animals were very reluctant to desert the home range, even when the last trees in the core area were being destroyed. Adult males and adult females responded differently to the destruction and resultant shift. The males appeared less nervous than the females and deserted the home range prior to them. The reaction of surrounding troops to the shift of troop A, strongly suggests territorial behavior among Nilgiri langurs. Finally, this shift, along with other observations reported elsewhere, demonstrates that Nilgiri langurs are quite adaptable and appear to possess the ability to survive in an ecology being rapidly destroyed by the human population.",

		"abstract": "Understanding animal movement often relies upon telemetry and biologging devices. These data are frequently used to estimate latent behavioral states to help understand why animals move across the landscape. While there are a variety of methods that make behavioral inferences from biotelemetry data, some features of these methods (e.g., analysis of a single data stream, use of parametric distributions) may limit their generality to reliably discriminate among behavioral states.To address some of the limitations of existing behavioral state estimation models, we introduce a non-parametric Bayesian framework called the mixed-membership method for movement (M4), which is available within the open-source bayesmove R package. This framework can analyze multiple data streams (e.g., step length, turning angle, acceleration) without relying on parametric distributions, which may capture complex behaviors more successfully than current methods. We tested our Bayesian framework using simulated trajectories and compared model performance against two segmentation methods (behavioral change point analysis (BCPA) and segclust2d), one machine learning method (expectation-maximization binary clustering (EMbC)), and one type of state-space model (hidden Markov model (HMM)). We also illustrated this Bayesian framework using movements of juvenile snail kites (Rostrhamus sociabilis) in Florida, USA.The Bayesian framework estimated breakpoints more accurately than the other segmentation methods for tracks of different lengths. Likewise, the Bayesian framework provided more accurate estimates of behavior than the other state estimation methods when simulations were generated from less frequently considered distributions (e.g., truncated normal, beta, uniform). Three behavioral states were estimated from snail kite movements, which were labeled as ‘encamped’, ‘area-restricted search’, and ‘transit’. Changes in these behaviors over time were associated with known dispersal events from the nest site, as well as movements to and from possible breeding locations.Our non-parametric Bayesian framework estimated behavioral states with comparable or superior accuracy compared to the other methods when step lengths and turning angles of simulations were generated from less frequently considered distributions. Since the most appropriate parametric distributions may not be obvious a priori, methods (such as M4) that are agnostic to the underlying distributions can provide powerful alternatives to address questions in movement ecology.",

		"abstract": "Wildlife scientists continue to be interested in studying ways to quantify how the movements of animals are interdependent – dynamic interaction. While a number of applied studies of dynamic interaction exist, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and applicability of available methods used for quantifying interactions between animals. We highlight the formulation, implementation and interpretation of a suite of eight currently available indices of dynamic interaction. Point- and path-based approaches are contrasted to demonstrate differences between methods and underlying assumptions on telemetry data. Correlated and biased correlated random walks were simulated at a range of sampling resolutions to generate scenarios with dynamic interaction present and absent. We evaluate the effectiveness of each index at identifying different types of interactive behaviour at each sampling resolution. Each index is then applied to an empirical telemetry data set of three white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) dyads. Results from the simulated data show that three indices of dynamic interaction reliant on statistical testing procedures are susceptible to Type I error, which increases at fine sampling resolutions. In the white-tailed deer examples, a recently developed index for quantifying local-level cohesive movement behaviour (the di index) provides revealing information on the presence of infrequent and varying interactions in space and time. Point-based approaches implemented with finely sampled telemetry data overestimate the presence of interactions (Type I errors). Indices producing only a single global statistic (7 of the 8 indices) are unable to quantify infrequent and varying interactions through time. The quantification of infrequent and variable interactive behaviour has important implications for the spread of disease and the prevalence of social behaviour in wildlife. Guidelines are presented to inform researchers wishing to study dynamic interaction patterns in their own telemetry data sets. Finally, we make our code openly available, in the statistical software R, for computing each index of dynamic interaction presented herein.",

		"abstract": "Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs), estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animals. Conceptually, slopes that vary by individual, that is, random coefficient models, could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach. While fitting such models for RSFs is possible with standard software for generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking. To close this gap, we take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i.e. the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific fixed intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference for random-slope models becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, or with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including models without random slopes and mixed conditional regression models fit using a two-step algorithm. Using data from mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) and Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for SSFs and to demonstrate the importance of including individual-specific slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.",

		"abstract": "1. Uncovering the mechanisms behind animal space use patterns is of vital importance for predictive ecology, thus conservation and management of ecosystems. Movement is a core driver of those patterns so understanding how movement mechanisms give rise to space use patterns has become an increasingly active area of research. 2. This study focuses on a particular strand of research in this area, based around step selection analysis (SSA). SSA is a popular way of inferring drivers of movement decisions, but, perhaps less well‐appreciated, it also parametrises a model of animal movement. Of key interest is that this model can be propagated forwards in time to predict the space use patterns over broader spatial and temporal scales than those that pertain to the proximate movement decisions of animals. 3. Here, we provide a guide for understanding and using the various existing techniques for scaling up step selection models to predict broad‐scale space use patterns. We give practical guidance on when to use which technique, as well as specific examples together with code in R and Python. 4. By pulling together various disparate techniques into one place, and providing code and instructions in simple examples, we hope to highlight the importance of these techniques and make them accessible to a wider range of ecologists, ultimately helping expand the usefulness of step selection analysis.",

		"abstract": "Predation risk, the probability that a prey animal will be killed by a predator, is fundamental to theoretical and applied ecology. Predation risk varies with animal behavior and environmental conditions, yet attempts to understand predation risk in natural systems often ignore important ecological and environmental complexities, relying instead on proxies for actual risk such as predator–prey spatial overlap. Here we detail the ecological and environmental complexities driving disconnects between three stages of the predation sequence that are often assumed to be tightly linked: spatial overlap, encounters and prey capture. Our review highlights several major sources of variability in natural predator–prey systems that lead to the decoupling of spatial overlap estimates from actual encounter rates (e.g. temporal activity patterns, predator and prey movement capacity, resource limitations) and that affect the probability of prey capture given encounter (e.g. predator hunger levels, temporal, topographic and other environmental influences on capture success). Emerging technologies and statistical methods are facilitating a transition to a more spatiotemporally detailed, mechanistic understanding of predator–prey interactions, allowing for the concurrent examination of multiple stages of the predation sequence in mobile, free-ranging animals. We describe crucial applications of this new understanding to fundamental and applied ecology, highlighting opportunities to better integrate ecological contingencies into dynamic predator–prey models and to harness a mechanistic understanding of predator–prey interactions to improve targeting and effectiveness of conservation interventions.",

Short-term mating competition is not a major function of IGA in C. capucinus. Males were the primary participants in IGA, but did not attempt to prevent extra-group copulations by herding females, and there was no relationship between IGA rate and conception rate. Long-term mating competition, on the other hand, may be important: 41% of interactions were low intensity, as would be expected if males were assessing the composition of neighboring groups in anticipation of a takeover. However, 59% of intergroup interactions escalated to chases or physical contact and females were frequent participants in IGA, directing aggression at adults of both sexes and at juveniles. These findings are not consistent with male mating competition and, in conjunction with overlapping home ranges, high interaction rate, and a positive relationship between IGA rate and both food availability and fruit patch size, they indicate that intergroup feeding competition may be important for capuchins. However, interactions do not preferentially occur at food sources, suggesting that capuchins may gain long-term, rather than short-term, benefits from IGA.",

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include both theory-driven and data-driven non-linear terms, auto-correlation structures, censoring and truncation, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their prior knowledge. Models can easily be evaluated and compared using several methods assessing posterior or prior predictions.

		"abstract": "Quantifying animal movements is necessary for answering a wide array of research questions in ecology and conservation biology. Consequently, ecologists have made considerable efforts to identify the best way to estimate an animal’s home range, and many methods of estimating home ranges have arisen over the past half century. Most of these methods fall into two distinct categories of estimators that have only recently been described in statistical detail: those that measure range distributions (methods such as Kernel Density Estimation that quantify the long-run behavior of a movement process that features restricted space use) and those that measure occurrence distributions (methods such as Brownian Bridge Movement Models and the Correlated Random Walk Library that quantify uncertainty in an animal movement path during a specific period of observation). In this paper, we use theory, simulations, and empirical analysis to demonstrate the importance of applying these two classes of space use estimators appropriately and distinctly. Conflating range and occurrence distributions can have serious consequences for ecological inference and conservation practice. For example, in most situations, home-range estimates quantified using occurrence estimators are too small, and this problem is exacerbated by ongoing improvements in tracking technology that enable more frequent and more accurate data on animal movements. We encourage researchers to use range estimators to estimate the area of home ranges and occurrence estimators to answer other questions in movement ecology, such as when and where an animal crosses a linear feature, visits a location of interest, or interacts with other animals.

		"abstract": "Knowing the influence of intrinsic and environmental traits on animals’ movement is a central interest of ecology and can aid to enhance management decisions. The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is a vulnerable mammal that presents low capacity for physiological thermoregulation and uses forests as thermal shelters. Here, we aim to provide reliable estimates of giant anteaters’ movement patterns and home range size, as well as untangle the role of intrinsic and environmental drivers on their movement. We GPS-tracked 19 giant anteaters in Brazilian savannah. We used a continuous-time movement model to estimate their movement patterns (described by home range crossing time, daily distance moved and directionality), and provide an autocorrelated kernel density estimate of home range size. Then, we used mixed structural equations to integratively model the effects of sex, body mass and proportion of forest cover on movement patterns and home range size, considering the complex net of interactions between these variables. Male giant anteaters presented more intensive space use and larger home range than females with similar body mass, as it is expected in polygynous social mating systems. Males and females increased home range size with increasing body mass, but the allometric scaling of intensity of space use was negative for males and positive for females, indicating different strategies in search for resources. With decreasing proportion of forest cover inside their home ranges, and, consequently, decreasing thermal quality of their habitat, giant anteaters increased home range size, possibly to maximize the chances of accessing thermal shelters. As frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and deforestation are increasing, effective management efforts need to consider the role of forests as an important thermal resource driving spatial requirements of this species. We highlight that both intrinsic and environmental drivers of animal movement should be integrated to better guide management strategies.",
