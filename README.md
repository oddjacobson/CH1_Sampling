# CH1: The Importance of Representative Sampling for Home Range Estimation in Field Primatology

This repository contains the analysis for the 1st chapter of my PhD. The code and html outputs are stored in the RMarkdown folder. 

The goal of this chapter is to assess how irregular sampling resulted from collecting data via handheld GPS on many groups non-simultaneously influences home range estimation.

We did this by thinning high quality subsets of the data to create fake sampling regimes that are aimed to reflect possible sampling designs in the field. Then we measure the performance of the home range estimates by plotting them over the total data from the high quality samples and calculate the proportion of the locations that fall within the 95% UD estimates. 

We then see how performance varies depending on sampling characteristics such as the number of unique weeks and the number of recorded locations in the regime.
